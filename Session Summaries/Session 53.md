Jenga and Haz have fangs left over from their transformation. Jenga uses Disguise Self to look human. It won't fool anyone of high ranking but will hold up.
There are guards at a door, one of which is Gymmy still posing as a cultist. The party gets by and goes into the crypts. The coffins have necromancy magic on them and this time, wisely, the party doesn't touch them. They discover a vault, in the center of which is a statue with an onyx ring on its middle finger. Jenga flips it off and the statue crumbles, leaving just the ring.

They proceed to a room with stairs crossing back and forth, slowly rising up. They fight deathlocks in this room, and loot adjacent rooms. The next room has some small black beads that come with a riddle of sorts.
`Safe from harm you shall be, if you throw one of the beads three.`
Yri throws a bead and is enclosed in a sphere of force. With eldritch blasts from Jenga and Yri's stabbing, he gets free.

The party continues, fighting more undead and a mummy lord.
