Jenga is like 'hey guys there's a dude named [[Ingimarr]] who I hate for many reasons and he took money from me so lets go beat him up.'
The party is on board. Jenga does a drug to raise her AC and the party finds a massive rowboat of sorts, with tall and pale imposing crew. Sarya poses as doing an investigation, and the party finds that they seek 'Ingimarr, Master of Thralls'. Jenga finds him leaving an auction house deep in Prospero and follows him. Ruey summons a direwolf, scaring Lunima and causing her to run off, followed by Sarya.

Jenga confronts Ingimarr by the docks, and he demands to solve things via talking. Jenga goes onto the boat with him to speak. It doesn't go well, and as she tries to teleport away, planning on burning the ship, he knocks her out.

An hour passes and the party worries. The ship Jenga went on with Ingimarr is departing so the Lady Ferrum quickly follows. A fight starts, and Haz finds Jenga, waking her with a health potion.

During the fight, Jenga accidentally sends a bunch of chained thralls to hell via 'Hurl Through Hell' along with Ingimarr. She hears Lorcan, in her head.
**"Care for me to barter for the bystanders in your stead?""**
*"What do you mean?"*
**"You seem to have made a mistake. I assume you didn't intend to destroy the psyche of a handful of enslaved persons along with their master."**
*"Yeah, no shit!"*
**"Do you wish for me to spare them?"**
*"Yes, obviously, is that something you can do?"*
**"Of course. Now, this will be at the cost of the actual trauma inflicted on their master."**
Jenga/Tess-as-the-player misunderstands.
*"To me? That'll kill me!!!"*
**"Not what I meant. He simple won't take it at all."**
*"Then fine, yes."*

She later asks, *"where did they go?"* To which Lorcan responds, **"they are in my company."**

The fight is half-won, as Ingimarr proclaims, "you have no right to do this. Tricksters and fiends. This isn't the last you've seen of us." He teleports away with another berserker. The remaining one commits seppuku. 

Jenga rummages through his desk and gets 5000 gold pieces back. The party tries to free the slaves on the boat but it is burning with magical fire than eventually consumes it. The ship sinks.

The Lady Ferrum continues to Fortuna. Jenga explains things to the party, saying that she saw Ingimarr dragging a young triton by a chain and couldn't tolerate that shit, so she paid Ingimarr for him, burned the paperwork, gave the kid some money and directed him to the ocean. She explain that Ingimarr seemed like a piece of shit and she wanted her money back. The party concludes that this was actually a pretty decent thing for Jenga to do.
post-campaign added note: lmao all of that was a lie

Side info the party learns about Thiala, she left the Underdark 73 years ago, when she wasn't quite yet out of Trancing. She suspects that she is currently around 160. 

Supposedly there is an item of great power in the [[Copper Dragonlord]]'s domain, in the Silver Key hideout, one that Sarya may find useful.
Sarya shares with Yri and Thiala that she intends on resurrecting her wife, and feels that the party brings her closest to that goal. Thiala asks if she has heard rumors about what the Copper Dragonlord has achieved.

More info from Thiala, regarding Lia: One of the most powerful people among the Lolthites decided that they had a fancy for Lia, and put her through hell for it. She was being initiated as a priestess when she heard the 'silver song' and Thiala implies that initiation into the clerical ranks of the drow is not a pleasant process. It's why she joined the Key, and while the Key's fight isn't the party's, they would love to take them under their wing should the party resolve all their own problems.

Sarya gathers the party on deck and speak to them all.
"I've gathered you here today because it's come to my attention that we've traveled together for quite some time, with the exception of Lunima and Ruey, and we haven't gotten to know each other that well. There's a secret I've been keeping from you all. Nothing to do with things I'm not at liberty to speak about but more so about things that I am. I figured it may be a good catalyst for all of us to get to know each other- obviously we know Jenga, she's done the most."
Jenga: "I fucked up the most. You can say it."
Sarya: "Jenga, how far are we from Menagerie?"
Jenga: "Three weeks, give or take a few stops."
Sarya: "That's a bit of time... I'd rather you know things in case something happens to me in that time, we're going to get closer anyways, I don't want to skirt around the issue when we get there. I, um... I'm sure you all have your own motivations for joining this party. I'm sure I know I good chunk of yours, including Lunima and Ruey's. But I know that none of you really know mine. That must make me a bit harder to approach than I would have liked. I'm sure the same goes for all of you amongst yourselves. There's no easy way to say this, but here it goes: I want to go to Menagerie to see the Copper Dragonlord because I'm on a quest to ressurect my dead wife. I don't have her body- I don't have anything- I lost it in the Feywild. She took her own life, due to a reason that was... not something she hsould have had to go through. I understand some of you may view me differently after I say this. The reason she took her own life was because of my own stupid actions when I was in this form known as Summer for Eladrin's seasons and basically- I don't know if- none of you know much about Eladrin- Seasons are basically moods taken to the extreme which can affect the personality very deeply. Summer is... The best way to say it is my agressive-slash-angry side. And... I was in Summer when she took her own life."
Jenga hugs Sarya. She hugs back but pulls away to continue.
"I essentially... There's no easy way to say this. In my anger I effectively bullied herself into killing herself, even though it's not what I intended. I wasn't myself at the moment, but I still did it. Ever since then I've been trying to become a better person, using my investigatory skills in order to get stuff to bring her back, give her back a chance at life, the one I stole from her. It was unfair of me to take something from her when she was so young. She was an elf like myself- I won't say what kind, some of you are disliking of certain kinds, so it's better I don't- but she was a good person through and through. Gentle, kind, caring. It's cause of me that she's dead. I want to bring her back more than anything. Knowing I messed up, I don't expect anything from her in return, I expect the second she's back she'd divorce me or whatever, I don't expect her to love me back, but... I'm still obligated to do it, and I shall. It's only the right thing to do. I don't know how much of the rest of it I'm at liberty to say. Other than... I assume her presence is still with me. That's the most I'm at liberty to say, I'm not too sure of the specifics. But that's my story."
Jenga: "We're not going to see you any differently."
Ruey picks a flower from her flower crown and hands it to Sarya.
Sarya prompts others to share so the party can get to know each other.
Ruey mentions to Jenga, "don't hate Yri, hate your enemies."
Jenga responds: "My enemies are not close at hand- Well, Yri's an easy target. Wait, that sounds bad."
Lunima shares, "you found me on a horrible zombie island, which was the worst place in the world, undisputed. I'm travelling now because I never had a chance to, my childhood was stolen from me because my parents were killed by the cult we just destroyed. I'm here because I owe a debt to you, and Jenga promised to give me food."

Jenga shares more of her backstory with the party, revealing that after the housefire that orphaned her, she joined a [[Scholar Cult|scholar cult]] that focused on the study of devils. During her five years in this cult, she eventually had a job negotiating with fiends for information in exchange for the souls of others (some more willing than others). 

Ruey simply states, "I'm in the material plane, not from it." She says she much prefers it here.

Haz proclaims his intentions to duel with Yri.
