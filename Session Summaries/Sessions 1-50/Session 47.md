The party arrives in the port [[Pescatrio]] in the morning. It's the same size as Amberstead, but less dense. Big on fishing and whaling industry. The hobgoblin embassy is in the capital town [[Karbone]], the seat of [[House Malaina]]. 
%%Not linked yet cause unsure of spelling%% 
3 crew members have a large bag. [[Nix]], [[Lad]], and [[Crow]] are going to commission the harpy feathers into something.

Jenga looks for a tavern and finds the [[Blubber Lover]]. After some drinks, the party decides to play with some magic beans in a large field nearby.

The first bean produces 9 black tentacles that try to grapple people. The second, planted by Yri, produced a bearded man in a silk outfit with the bouquet of lilies. He gives one to Clarity, says it is from Yri, and vanishes.
The third bean is planted by Clarity. Over a dozen giant boars appear from the ground. The party fights them off and gets pork off them.
Gymmy plants a bean that sprouts a magical sapling. It's wood can be used to make magic items like arrows, so the party chops it down to give to Larry.
Kari's bean has an enchantment effect on her. 

The bean comes with this message to those who are under it's influence: 

*The lucky person who pulls this bean out of the bag never gets to plant it. In fact, it will abhor them to even think of burying this beautiful object in the ugly, dirty ground. The puller of the bean becomes completely enraptured by it. It becomes their favorite object -- they will never part with it. They must have it with them at all times, even when sleeping (which could become a problem if they are (ahem) accompanied). They value no person, deed, or possession over this bean (paladins watch out). They will often be found simply holding their bean lovingly and staring at it.*

Haz manages to get the bean from her, but now the party needs to get it from Haz. Jenga ends up with it and the party does Remove Curse on her, ending the effect, and the bean is immediately buried. 4 fiendish hounds sprout from the spout. When they are defeated, they leave behind a [[Tome of Leadership and Influence]].

More beans are planted. Notably, one produces a well that can grant several Wishes. The party first wishes for medical gear, and get strange devices that seem to need a power source, but don't seem to be magical. Jenga is able to use a wish to figure out her unknown mom's last known location, which according to the well is Maplewood, but she has no current residence.

Haz uses the final wish. He receives a body pillow in the form of Shava (and one of Bureizu, which goes to Sarya), and a silver and onyx glowing necklace (the glow goes away). It resembles the amulet of drow detection the Silver Key gave the party, and Jenga realizes it will glow near Shava specifically. 

Clarity casts Commune with her god.
"Is Shava alive?"
*Unclear.*
"Is her body in the abyss?"
*Yes.*
"Is Shava suffering?"
*Unclear.*

The last bean planted just makes rubber balls fall from the sky.

After some shenanigans with [[The Sphere of Future Knowledge]], the party turns in for the night.

The next day, they start on a 3 day long southward trip, across the border of the Bernato Alliance and into the [[Notos Confederacy]].

Crossing the border, they are flagged down by a ship with the Bernator flag, heavily upgraded with scale sails, a reinforced hull, and full cannons. They meet a well dressed tabaxi who speaks to them.
Tabaxi: "By the order of our prince and savior [[Sir Merichias the Fourth]], any mercantile passenger from these waters must pay a travelling fine of 10,000 gold to pay for protection within the water by our lord and savior, or else sail outside of our borders."

The party has the choice to either pay the large fee or risk a nasty storm out over the ocean. They pick the storm, in part to avoid their cargo (The Silver Key) being discovered. 

The storm attacks the boat with 'arms' of it, that are magically empowered winds called 'flaywind' that are composed of shardlike hail and bone fragments that can rend off one's flesh. There's the potential that it's artificially created.

Most of the party and crew go below decks leaving only Jenga and Clarity, who tie themselves to the mast and wheel. Sailing through the storm, they continually take damage. With healing from Clarity, they survive until Clarity herself has to go below decks, and Jenga comes out on the other side of the storm barely alive thanks to a successful Divine Intervention done by Gymmy. The weather around the ship in a bubble faded, and the boat was seemingly being pushed by a large black dragon. Jenga went below decks when it told her "friend of our lady's servant, go, you are not needed here."

Later, a tall humanoid in a black silk outfit (the dragon, in human form) enters through the hatch, picks up some pig from below decks, and carries out on his shoulders saying to Gymmy, "you're lucky I was near. Our lady has business in the area."
Gymmy: "Thank you very much."
Dragon: "?? brings notice, ? not an inactive servant. It would please her greatly if you were."

The party thus passes the storm with success and is now within the 'eye' of it. The ship comes to beach on an island shaped like a ring. Upon the moment of arrival, Kari declares that she's out. She takes a contract with some contingencies Lorcan offered, pricks her thumb, presses it down, and she vanishes.

The shore is lined with crashed ships, some with the flags of the Notos Confederacy. There are figures moving on the shore, in patterns no *living* creature would make.
