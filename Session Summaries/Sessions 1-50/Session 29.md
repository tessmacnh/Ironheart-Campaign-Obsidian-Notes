The party makes camp in the dragon's lair. Gymmy has a dream from his deity. Jenga has a vision from her patron. 

The party returns to Westmill with the head of the dragon on their cart. Cheers follow them as they go to the castle. Baroness Pendra plans on throwing a feast in their honor!

Jenga does the Find Familiar ritual to get her [[Jenga's Familiar|familiar]], an orange owl named Acorn.

At the feast, Finnwell recounts the tale of the battle, with Sarya's music playing in the background.

The party learns that the Amberleaf family is a branch of the ruling Brazenleaf family. Eloise is a distant niece of [[King Norman Bronzeleaf]]. Baroness Pendra is a vassal of the duchess and while she is supportive, she thinks if the duchess takes no action things will escalate and she will have to take a military stand.

They also learn the diplomats Bureizu was dealing with back in Amberstead were ambassadors from [[Shenjin]], a land on the other side of the planet where Bureizu is from. More likely, a member of the inquisitions there, who supposedly work to deal with the cultists of chromatic dragons but are more often seen as fanatically chasing after accussed cultists.

The feast goes well. Pendra does some research for Sarya and says she will let her know if she finds a teleportation circle for [[Menagerie]], a trade hub in the area of the world known for being the [[Copper Dragon Kingdom]].

The party sleeps in the castle, and after a nice breakfast the morning of 43rd, the Baroness teleports them back to Amberstead!!

Meeting the party there is the half high elf who interrogated them after Vopina's supposed death. It's [[Drusilla Liadon]], the investigator in Amberstead. She brings the party to the Gilderlook.

The duchess gives Finnwell a ceremonial title, 'Finnwell the Drakesbane.' This means he can own property in the lord's quarters, and is considered a part of the noble court even though he isn't nobility.

The duchess shows a recovered document. It is the [[Vopina's Will|Will of Vopina Crimsonleaf]]. 

![[Vopina's Will]]

In it, Vopina leaves to the party a house in Amberstead. Because Finnwell can own the property, it will be left in his name, but the duchess needs a name for the group.

The group decides upon the group name __The Ironhearts.__ The new house is thus dubbed the [[Ironheart Estate]], which costs 50 gold a month to keep.

A halfling named [[Geralt]] shows the Ironhearts to their new house. It's a crimson red house about 100 ft across and two stories high. 

The party does some shopping. To fit in around the Lord's Quarter they need new outfits so they visit the tailor at [[The Golden Thread]] for some nice outfits. Gimbal orders a new mask of porcelain and later goes to drop money off at his family's house.

Jenga goes to the library on [[Campus Historia]] and meets with Caelynn. They go to talk at the coffee house on campus. Caelynn is able to help Jenga ugrade her Rod of the Pact Keeper, but needs Jenga to get some things for her.

The next day, Jenga gets a ruby from a jeweler, one of the things Caelynn needs. She also takes Shava on a date to the bakery! It's a bit awkward, but Shava does ask Jenga on the way back if she wants to get drinks together.

Jenga and Gimbal pair up to steal the cashbox from a glassblower merchant. Jenga acts as the distraction while Gimbal sneaks off with the box.
