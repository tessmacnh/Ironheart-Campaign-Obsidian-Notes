It's still raining. Jenga stabilized Morrowzeer and the party ties his up and wakes him. 

The interrogation begins. When he doesn't answer the first question, the party chops off the first knuckle of his finger. He tells the party that his real name is Briel. He is asked why he betrayed the party and he says it's because they are chromatic dragon worshippers. The party laughs at this, pointing out that they killed a green dragon. 
He doesn't answer the third question of why he was with the Silver Key, leading to the loss of another knuckle, and says the inquisition and Silver Key have had long lasting contacts, and they used to work with the empire.

Bureizu admits that he was exiled from [[Shenjin]] by the inquisition who almost executed him. They apparently tried to get the duchess to execute him by starting a rumor that he was a cultist.
Briel confesses that Bureizu was the main target, the rest of the part was just associated. When asked who assigned him to this mission, Briel holds out a hand in preperation for a finger to be chopped off, the the party chops off a toe instead. He says his leader was [[High Justicar Yong Xiao]] and he came from the embassy. Larry says he doubts that Shenjin has the standing to send troops to deal with people in Amberstead.

The party finishes looting and Bureizu kills Morrowzeer, kicking him from the top of the tower he was interrogated on. The party burns the bodies inside the temporary fortress and continues their travels.

Finnwell later on spots two figures coming closer. Jenga looked through her owl familiar and sees 3 figures on horseback. Yri, Sarya, and Zawisza. 
Yri says he was sent by the duchess to investigate 'planar disturbances' and Zawisza says that the person who was going to get her to the feywild had 'other obligations.'

Jenga takes watch that night despite having not slept the previous one. The next day, the 63rd, is Yri's birthday. 

The party does not sleep the next night either. Finnwell sees a storm offshore taking the form of a beast.

Finally, the party gets to sleep. As the sun rises on the 65th, the party is nearly at the next civilization. It is on the 66th that they arrive at [[Masonport]], a city of stone and cliffs. Jenga helps Thiala talk their way past the gate keeper, and the party enters the city, navigating down to the second level of the cliffside to a tavern called the [[Motely Otter]].
The party enters the cliff and finds a tavern seemingly carved from the stone. It's run by [[Mellavin Stormbond]]. The party also notices that they can't find Gimbal.
