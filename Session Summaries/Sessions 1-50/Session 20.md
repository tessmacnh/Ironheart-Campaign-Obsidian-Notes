"Rider from the south!" Says someone on watch.

Bureizu returns to the party! He was busy in Amberstead dealing with diplomats who were accusing him or worshipping chromatic dragons, and had to fight his way along the path as the rest of the party had, but he is finally united with them. The party fills him in on what he missed.

Larry gets to keep a swivel gun, and it gets mounted on the wagon. Jenga tells Bureizu about their previous goblin encounter, and Yri notices her recounting how the goblin described Shava as 'squinty' and is now suspcious, as he doesn't yet know that Shava is a drow.

Larry and Yri begin working on a project to make a gauntlet with a hidden blade in it.

Several hours of travel later, the party hears loud growling up ahead. They see an elven woman up on a log, with auburn skin and gold eyes, a leather top and colorful skirt. She is trying to deal with large black felines with tentacles from their shoulders- displacer beasts.

The party helps her, and during the fight Bureizu accidently lets slip that Shava is a drow. 

The eladrin elf introduces herself as [[Sarya Ralorora|Sarya]]. Yri isn't too fazed by Shava being a drow. Jenga is shocked to learn that Yri somehow now speaks Elvish. Sarya and Gimbal have a backflip contest and Jenga eats gunpowder (it's bitter and salty).

Sarya is looking for someone named [[Verzilverd|Zil]]. Larry checks the map and says there is the ruin of an abandoned fort about a mile to the west. Yri summons his elk steed, [[Mars]], to ride as the party continues.

Jenga tries to apologize to Shava about the incident back at the outpost.

S: "Pardon me for being blunt, but if you knew me not, if I were that soldier, would you heal me?"
J: "Shava, I- I can't answer that question."
Jenga tries to make sure Shava doesn't feel like a burden to the party, but she says she doesn't intent to be one, and removes the dagger and pin from her ear to make a point that technically, her need for both of those things could be seen as a burden. The conversation doesn't get anywhere and there's a fundamental lack of understanding between the two of them that makes it awkward to really discuss anything. 
Shava offers Jenga a health potion, and when Jenga refuses on the grounds that she would feel bad, Shava insisted since Jenga paid for the materials. She takes back the dagger and pin.
