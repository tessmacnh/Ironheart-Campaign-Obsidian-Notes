Aside from a locked door on the other wall, the room is nondescript. There are faint seams on the wall where the elf is.
"Welcome, are you here for the trial?"
The party asks what she means.
"Have you not completed other trials?"
"Oh, yes."
"Obviously you're seeking to retrieve the item of importance stored her."
"Ideally, yes, is that alright?"
"I would like for you and your companions to step into the room."

The girl says, "only two of you appear to qualify for the trial." She points to Shava, who is currently disguised as a half wood elf, and Jenga. Jenga says that Shava isn't actually half wood elf.
"Then you're the only one who qualifies. Thank you for telling me. It would be a shame if the trial claimed someone. The rest of you are free to step out of the chamber."

The door shuts, Jenga is alone with the girl.
Girl: "Are you prepared to take on the trial?"
J: "Is there anything you can tell me?"
Girl: "The room we are entering is filled with traps. I will be your guide through it."

She leads Jenga over a grid of tiles on the floor, stepping on certain ones, and Jenga follows. They talk as they navigate the room. The girl asks about Jenga's name, and says it sounds familiar. She asks if Jenga knows the origin of it, and when Jenga says she doesn't, the girl says she does not either. 
She reveals that her dad was a high mage who made 'dead things.'

They reach the opposite room. On a pedestal is a [[Rod of the Pact-Keeper|rod]], with crystals filled with flame. Jenga picks it up and feels a familiar presence, the connection to her patron is amplfied through this rod. When she picks it up, the door to the room slams shut.

The girl mentions that she was made in the image of her creator's daughter. She isn't dead nor alive, and hasn't seen anyone in centuries. She gives Jenga the true dilemma of the trial: The door will not open if the rod is off the pedestal and she is still alive. If she wants to leave with the rod, she must kill the girl. Jenga is shocked to hear this.
Girl: "The item functions for you. My creator was suspicious of your type."
J: "Half elves or warlocks?"
Girl: "You are part of a pact with an otherworldly creature."
Girl, cont: "Part of this trial is to test your willingness to do what must be done when the time comes. That is what I was told."

Jenga doesn't want to kill the girl and instead talks to her for a bit longer.
J: "Can you tell me about wood elves?"
Girl: "It is a common ritual- more like training- that the wood elves have known for a long time. Basically, it ensures your spirit lingers on the material plane. Could be like the wood elf you met (refering to the ghost Jenga had told her about). I'm not knowledgable of the history of your people."

Jenga asks for the girl's name, but she has none. Finally, after lots of mental back-and-forth, she decides to go through with things. The girl turns to face the wall and Jenga fires two eldritch blasts at her back. Those were not enough to kill her, as she stands back up after being pushed into the wall, so Jenga panics and shoots her again. 
The girl vanishes in a burst of flame, and all that remains is a sundress with some holes in it. 

Jenga takes the rod and casts Fly on herself to get back over the tiles. It seems the runes have been deactivated. She meets with the party waiting outside but refuses to talk about what happened in her trial.

The next room, the panflute symbol one, has a mural of the Autumnwood, and the positions of animals seem to corrospond to musical notes. In an Elvish inscription it says, `play the song of the forest`.
Sarya uses the notes to play an elvish song, and a door slides open. There is an ocarina, with elven letters spelling out [[Dukh Bardic College|Dukh]], the name of the bardic college Sarya went to. Enchanted ocarinas were gien to the graduates of the first class. This is the [[Dukh Ocarina]]

The next room, with the crossed bones symbol, has a glowing crystal in the floor with some sort of evocation spell of divine origin. The next room has a mild haze and a sigil on the floor. Sarya stes into the mist but collapses, with poison and exhaustion effects. Yri pulls her back and the crystal flashes, curing her. Yri, as a paladin, is the only one who can safely proceed. He later returns, having fought a minotaur and claimed his prize.

The party back-tracks to the door marked with the symbol of a doorway. The room has a door and a lever in it. Over the lever is the symbol of an eye. Gimbal steps forward and the eye glows, detecting them. Gimbal uses his invisible mage hand to pull the lever, and the door opens. The next room has a symbol for illusion, and Gimbal uses an illusion of himself to pull the lever in that one. The next one has some sort of symbol over the door, like old elven symbols. Maybe a crest of name. Larry says everything in the room is magc, but the lever only faintly so, with enchantment magic on it. Gimbal pulls the lever, and his eyes glow a bit, same with Sarya when she tries. Yri uses divine sense and there is a strong undead presence from the two of them. Sarya touches the door and it glows a red color that intensifies as she keeps her hand there. Bringing them back to the crystal room does not fix them. Finnwell tries to block the party from going back in the room, Yri fails to dropkick him, and the door is now making a rather loud noise. The party finally lights the torches in the sconces around the room and the undead presence leaves. The door slides open. The final chamber has a needle resting on a pillow. It can repair objects and also transform into a dagger.

The room with the crossed, cannon-like markings has a large pedestal with a glass box. On the outside there is a tray. Inside is a two foot lone six inch diameter gun with glowing sigils on it. 
An inscription on the tray says `collateral`. Larry puts his [[Enchanted Handkerchief]] on it and a door closes over it, the front pane of glass opens. He takes the cannon.

After all the puzzles, the party returns to the hot tubs to relax. Jenga attunes to her rod and promptly gets drunk. Larry takes the first shower of his life. Sarya has some shenanigans going invisible and turns visible, about to pull Jenga's hair, when Haz bites her. Yri restrains Has and releases him when Sarya leaves to go find and talk to Bureizu.

Jenga can't find Shava gets worried so she goes looking for her. She accidently walks in on Shava, undressed and bathing in a different tub. Jenga hastily apologizes and leaves the room. 

When the party finishes with that, Jenga, still a bit drunk, presses the `DO NOT PRESS dumbass` button, which opens a door revealing the figure of a wood elf, handsome features worn with emancipation. He coughs and asks "what year is it?"
"1164."
"What?"
"Pose founding."
"I don't know what that is."
It then stares at Sarya and questions, "where is [[Zoka Starwake|Zoka]]?"
Sarya drops her rapier in surprise, and he looks angry.
Man: "What did you do?"
Sarya: "Look, hey, who are you? How do you know them?"
Man: "Because I know them. I need an answer. Now."
Sarya: "We were a thing a whileback. Apparently that's now off."
Man: "Yeah. For a long time."

Sarya becomes frightened. A fight slowly begins and the prisoner speaks in Elvish.
"Heh, I suppose you have me cornered now, don't you think? This form has little use for me anymore."
He grows larger, his skin becomes warty, and he reveals himself to be a slaad.
His ability to frighten people is bit of a hinderance during the fight, but Gymmy manages to kill it.

The party is pretty upset with Jenga, and Bureizu tells her she isn't allowed to drink for a week. Larry finds a hidden cubby with a mug saying `#1 admin`. The party returns to the cart. That night on watch, Bureizu hears a distant roar, like that of a wyvern.
