Gymmy does... something, in his downtime, no one is really sure what. 

The party returns to [[Andri's]]. Andri tells Jenga that her friend is awake but doesn't speak the common tongue. Jenga explains she has business with the duchess and goes to see [[Shava]]. She brings Gimbal with her.

Shava is sitting on the bed, arms around her legs. Jenga asks (in Elvish) if she is alright, but she doesn't respond.

J: "Andri says you haven't been eating much. Is there a reason?"
S: "No, I'm not sick, but I still feel ill."
J: "Like, emotionally ill?"
S: ".... I'm your servant now."
J: (very confused and taken off guard) "No, that's not how this works."
S: "That's the promise I made."
J: "No no no-" (she panics)
S: I will leave if you want.
J: "No, no, I want you to stay... I enjoy your company. I want your company as like, a companion, you can travel with the rest of us."
S: "I cannot reciprocate that."
J: "How so what do you mean?"
S: "You don't understand my people much, do you?"
J: "Mmm... Nope."
S: "I'll keep it simple. You've proven yourself superior to me, so I am your servant... I could be your consort but I feel that's not what you want."
J: "No, I was... I was hoping the feelings would come naturally. I want you to be my friend."
S: "Friend?" She doesn't seem to understand.
Jenga tries to explain.
J: "You know, when... People are equal, and care about each other-"
Shava seems to think that Jenga is belittling her. Jenga turns to Gimbal for help. After she explains the situation to him, as he doesn't know Elvish, he says that Jenga's really only better when it comes to combat. For example, Jenga is better than him at talking to people, but he's better at picking locks.
Jenga tells this to Shava who seems frustrated.
S: "You don't understand. You are greater than me in the order of the world, it's not just being the better fighter, I'm- I'm also weaker than I was then. It's not so simple at being better at fighting."
J: "Are all the drow like this?"
S: "It's how I understand the world."
J: "You can be your own person if you're travelling with us, you know, right?"
S: "I suppose."
J: (relieved) "Great, so you can come with us."

Shava asks what to do in terms of her own skills. She could take one of 3 paths as a warrior, a mage, or an assisstant. However she isn't very strong, according to her own words, and the party has spell casters already. Jenga tries asking "What do you want?" But Shava just replies with "I have no magical training, I'm physically weakened, and I have no useful skills." Seeing as she's not going to get any help making the choice, Jenga tells Shava to focus on accumulating skills. Shava begins to learn insight, survival, medicine, arcana, and healing/herbal kit proficiency.

The week is wrapping up. To get Larry's Dust of Dryness, the party needs to take on dust mephits, which are found in the catacombs. They go to the temple district and into the catacombs. The dust mephit fight is long and hard, as the mephits keep mulitplying. After a long and hard fight in which the party kills a total of 102 dust mephits, the party takes the cash reward which is probably enough to nearly bankrupt the church. In addition, Haz initimdates the woman at the church to give him a halberd that is given to Yri. It is the [[Corpse-slayer Halberd]]. 

Shopping time again! Larry gets a covered wagon and a donkey to carry it named [[Fitzy]]

Jenga buys an herbalism kit and material pouches for Shava.
