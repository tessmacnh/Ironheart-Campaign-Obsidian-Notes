The party fights pig looking demons with cutlery. A wooden walled in area has screaming from within. The party rolls a boulder aside to find a bunch of miners, some already dead but some still living. They retreat from the mine with the miners in tow.

The Watchers arrive with [[Clarity Duwell]], the cleric who Jenga fought in the arcane tournament back in Amberstead, as reinforcement. They were on patrol and came by at the perfect time.

The party takes a long rest.
