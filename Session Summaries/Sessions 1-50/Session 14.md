Jenga gets another vision from her patron.

It is the 26th of Springtide and time for the party to leave Amberstead. They are told that they will be going north as a vanguard for the actual expedition that will be sent out a few weeks behind them. During the trip they will locate and summarize the conditions of old fortifications along the northern border. They will continue along the border to the territory of [[Baroness Pendra]], who will arrange for their return. 
The party will meet on the north bridge later that day and depart from there.

The party gets the [[Dagger of the Envoy]], which allows the attuner to speak and understand Common. Jenga gives it to Shava and also explains the situation between her and Shava to the party. 

The party embarks on their journey. Shava starts making health potions. Bureizu does not come with them, but Yri does.

On the 27th of Springtide, the party comes to a bridge that is strangely wet. Gimbal does some scouting and finds a troll. The party pokes fun at it for some time before combat starts. 

There turns out to be two trolls, not one. Haz accidently knocks out Larry at one point, but Larry passes his death saves. Eventually both of them are killed. Gimbal again freaks out over killing something. 
The party loots the trolls for some magic rings. 

The next day the party splits their rations with mayonaisse from the [[Alchemy Jug]] that has been magically flavored to taste like pancakes. Shava finishes another health potion.

The party travels the next day and makes camp, only to be ambushed by goblins riding wolves. 
In the conflict, a goblin looks at [[Gimbal]], takes a good look, then shakes his head.

The party levels up to level 5!!

A goblin is captures. Yri starts to interrogate it.

Goblin: "What do you want, skinling?"
Y: "Information."
Goblin: "Why should I give it to ya?"
Y: "Well if you don't, I'm personally against it but I'm sure a few people here don'tmind slaughtering people while they're unable to fight back."
Goblin: "Meh, very cute."
Jenga draws a dagger to the goblin's neck and stares it in the eyes. Its poker face drops and its eyes widen in fear.
Goblin: "Okay okay what do you want to know? I know all sorts of things I'm sure."
Jenga: "Yri, you can ask questions now."
Y: "We want to know what we'd encoutner, where we're going."
Goblin: "Where you heading? North, south, somewhere else?"
Y: "Mostly north. Up to Firham."
Goblin: "Ah, alright, there's a village about a day's ride from here. Used to be good (?) for slaves, they moved out a while back for some reason. A couple of friends- eh, not friends- acquaintences of mine took a look and didn't come back."
Y: "Anything else?"
Jenga: "One of y'all looked funny at Gimbal back there, why?"
Goblin: "Ask the guy who looked funny- oh wait, he's dead. Is he the fellow in the wraps?"
Jenga: "He's the small green one."
Goblin: "Well, can't see much. Doesn't look special. No special belongings. Wouldn't made a good slave like you and the squinty one." (Referring to Jenga and Shava.)
Jenga: "I dunno if that's a compliment or not. Probably not."
Yri: "Any bad monster things around here?"
Goblin: "Owlbears and the like."
Jenga: "Eh, we fought one before, we'll be fine."
Y: "You working for anyone?"
Goblin: "I work for myself."
Gymmy: "You decided to attack us yourself?"
Goblin: "Yeah you look like you carry valuables. Some people pay good money for knifeears like you. Especially her over there." (He says the last part to Jenga and points at Shava)
Jenga: (pissed) "Can I kill him now?"
Larry: "Do you have a loot stash?"
Goblin: "I could give you money for the squinty one."

Jenga eldritch blasts the goblin, and he dies. She returns the rope that had been binding him to Gimbal. 

Jenga shows off her Mask of Many Faces invocation by turning into Larry, freaking out Haz when he can't find her. They discuss how messy Larry's hair is. 

Yri pulls Jenga aside. They have a conversation that is loosely summarized as:
Yri: "What were you thinking when you executed that goblin?"
Jenga: "I was thinking it was saying mean things about Shava."
Yri: "You killed something with dreams, a family, etc."
Jenga: "It could have done bad things. I did the world a favor."
Yri: "Maybe."

The party continues travelling until they come to a fork in the road. We've reached the first settlement on our map, the [[Silent Settlement]].

We arrive at the town at nightfall.
