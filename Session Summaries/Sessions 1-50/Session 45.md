To quote directly from my notes, "DEMONS OH MY GOD SO MANY DEMONS"

The party books it as demons pour in a horde from the portal, practically a fluid substance. Larry uses a [[Monsoon Bolt]] to push some back. From the room comes a bright flash.
Jenga teleports Haz down the hall but find rocks collapsed behind them the party will have to get through, so they help clear it. Yri drinks a potion labelled "light" and gets laser eyes. 

The party reaches a center room. As demons swarm in from all sides, Jenga summons the [[Nightmare Steed]] and Kari and Larry get on. Kari casts Haste on the horse and Jenga takes it to the Ethereal Plane, where it speeds out of the mines.

Next trip, she takes Haz and Sarya. Demons are still closing in. Gymmy has a Dawn spell blocking on the 3 enterances to the room. Finally, Clarity, Gimbal, and Gymmy all flee with Jenga just as demons start to attack the steed.

The party escapes the mines successfully! It was heavily implied that the portal Jenga accidently opened was closed from the other side, thus causing the flash of light.

The party goes to speak to the [[High Warden]] of the Watchers, a leonin from [[Calathor]]. She says that in exchange for most of the party's payment, she can bring Finnwell back from the dead.

After a long rest, the party watches as the High Warden places the head upon the corpse of Finnwell, and he is revived! The party fills him in on things, Gimbal is thrilled to see him again, and Haz starts returning everything he took from Finnwell, which was a lot.

Outside, Clarity casts divine intervention to try and bring Bureizu back from Hell. It succeeds, at first. A gate opens up and the party sees Bureizu fighting demons. Fire blasts from the gate, damaging those nearby, and a ten feet tall angelic figure with black wings says "not yet" in Infernal. 

Yeah that's [[Zariel]].

In a private tent, Jenga finally talks to the party and explains that she has sold her soul to a half-devil in exchange for magical powers, and that she was indeed drunk at the time.

Clarity examines the rock Jenga got, it seems to be a magical battery of some sort. A guard asks to take a look at it and Jenga refuses. However, the guard then says that he wants to bring it to Artificer *Lorcan*. Hearing the name of her patron, Jenga switches her opinion, and manages to go alone with the guard.

The guard is clearly charmed. He takes Jenga into town and eventually leaves her in front of an empty stall. Eventually, someone taps her shoulders. It's Lorcan, disguised as a tiefling.

Lorcan has her leave the stone outside the storefront, saying it will push the person who finds it to reach out to him. She leaves it under the counter and they talk as they walk.
He says that he is using a spell of his own design, where people see him but won't register his physical presence, similar to invisibility but without the inconvenience of bumping into others. 
Acknowledging that her friends know about their relationship as warlock and patron, he asks her if she wants him to talk with them at that time- in a restaurant in town- or later. He would discuss some agreements with her friends, so that they won't interfere with things. Jenga agrees to have the meeting happen immediately, so as to rip the bandage off, so to speak.
Lorcan taps her on the head, and she goes unconscious.

The party tries to figure out what happened. They found Jenga in a ditch near a guard who was screaming with his eyes bleeding. 

Jenga convinces the party to go with her to town. She is honest in telling them that her patron wants to meet them, and encourages them to keep an open minds.

The party gets to a restaurant, [[The Maiden of the East]] where they already have reservations made, and they all meet Lorcan, still in his guise of a tiefling. 

Sarya starts with: "I assume you're not actually a tiefling, right?"
Lorcan: "Opening with questions about heritage, how polite of you. Should I ask how elf you half-elves are? I am, in fact, half-fiend. As much as is my right to leave this meeting after that rude question, I want to continue on a better foot. I am known as Lorcan, the benefactor of your friend here. Please to meet your acquaintance."
Sarya: "I dunno what I was expecting."

Lorcan insists that the meeting is a brunch, and he is paying for it. Jenga and Sarya take seats next to him, Clarity sits furthest away, and Yri refuses to sit down at all. 
Lorcan recommends the pheasant fillet. Clarity asks him about the failed divine intervention on Bureizu and he says he doesn't know why it failed.

Lorcan: "I'd like to form a mutual non-aggression pact."
Clarity: "How would that benefit us?"
Lorcan: "I nor my subordinates will ever bring harm to any of you, and in exchange you and your lot cause no harm to me or my sworn, nor will you interfere with out duties."
Clarity: "What's your end goal?"
Lorcan: "Why don't I ask what you want to do with your whole life? I promise, I have no intent to cause harm to Jenga or make her anything immoral, beyond petty theft. The material plane is not in the list of my interests. My job description is quite the opposite: Against the demons who would like to conquer the material."

Sarya: "I dunno if I'm stepping to far but I would like to know what you intend to do with Jenga's soul when she dies."
Lorcan: "Depends, frankly. It's not set in stone, it would be foolish to plan so far ahead for something. I can't do much with her soul if it's **?** when it reaches me, and I have no need to consume it for sustenance. To be honest I'm just fine with these delicious kebabs."

He later says:
"It's unfair concerning the leverage I have over the lot of you to "ask" you to agree to this non-aggression pact, when I more then have the force to force you to, but I prefer to play fair. So, I'd like to offer additional incentives done on a case by case basis. I'm not asking you to sell your soul and make a pact like your friend, but I may be able to provide services some of you would be willing to agree to."
Sarya: "Another question. How much do you know about all of us?"
Lorcan: "Another uncomfortable question. I suppose you were expecting me to be a big thing with wings and horns-"
Jenga: (muttered) "You do have some, to be fair."
Lorcan: "I know as much as your friend here knows. In any case, I assume you, Miss Clarity, want little to do with me as possible."
Clarity: "That's an understatement."
Lorcan: "We'll start simple."

One by one, people go speak to Lorcan, except for Haz and Jenga.

The party talks in the meantime. They confirm that Gimbal is a child, and he's adventuring to help provide for his family.

Jenga does eventually go and speak to him herself.
She gets confirmation that Lorcan wasn't aware that the stone would open a portal. She also learns that Shava's body is in the demonweb pits. 
L: "Your fighter friend... He is a sight to behold."
J: "He is, right?"
L: "Yes, he's really good at demon murder."
He says that unless his superiors are interested, there isn't much he can do to aid Bureizu. 
Jenga asks if getting the stone was worth it. Lorcan says it is. Their new friend will be able to apply artifice to eldritch. Like if Larry could hand anyone his cannon, but intead of ice, it's blasting.
L: "With you as the perfect face, Caelynn in Amberstead as a scholar supreme, he will be the ultimate artificer."
Lorcan remarks that Larry's monsoon bolts are impressive.

(Possibly more party chat happened but that concludes the session's notes.)
