Some of the party fight crocodiles by the river. Levi needs to return to his boat and horse, so he says his farewell and splits from the party.

Up ahead there is a fortified tower, and behind that, there is a village at the edge of civilization. Beyond that is the seat of the local baron.
The party travels, Bureizu hears a louder wyvern roar. Shava finishes a health potion.

Gimbal consults the party on what new spell to learn. Jenga knows of 'Flock of Familiars' and Shava suggests Spider Climb or Levitate. Haz says he should learn how to breath like a dragon.
Gymmy is all "you must find a spell that speaks to you, that you really feel with, think of what you want to do, if it lets you do it... Even if you do it very poorly, even if you have to do it by breaking every known law."

During that night's watch, the party is ambushed by ettercaps who followed them, in addition to phase spiders. 
After the fight, Jenga uses her Wand of Smiles on Bureizu and he storms off, pissed. Larry somehow has a coffee maker, and in the morning, Jenga is thrilled to have coffee.

Half a day of travel later, the party is at a [[High Elves' Tower|stonework tower]]. Coming down from the top with a roar is a wyvern with a high elven rider on its back. She wants to greet us, and says her sisters also would but they are busy. Jenga and Sarya speak to her. This woman is [[May]], and she is the youngest of three sisters who live in the tower. The party informs May that they need to check the integrity of the tower, and while the elf is fine with them inspecting the outside, she doesn't want them inside, as she and her sisters are soon to be doing a ritual. May says they do elven high magic, which normally consists of rituals done by cities, but they've replicated it with a few people. They say they can let one person in, and they pick Jenga (who May calls 'the pretty one'). Jenga rides the wyvern with May to the inner courtyard of the tower, which is stocked with alchemical plants. 

May gives Jenga a tour of the lower floors. She says she would like to prepare her a meal but is out of ingredients. Jenga meets the middle sister, [[Morgan]], who is reading. She is told that the eldest sister, [[Ethel]], is working on the ritual for that night. 
Jenga returns to the party and May whispers to her, "I hope to see you again, you're pleasant to be around." Jenga wouldn't mind returning, she thinks it's a pretty cool place.
May says if the party needs them to render their services, they will be here. Jenga writes up her report for the duchess.

As the sun sets the party arrives at [[Westmill]] and get settled in at the tavern [[The Plucky Duck]]. Yri promptly gets smashed. The party gets rooms and does some shopping at the [[Westmill General Store|general store]], but Jenga has to drag away Sarya, who is very drunk. Jenga later returns to by charcoal, herbs, and incense for her Find Familiar ritual and also sells her goodies from the mausoleum in the Silent Settlement.

The party spends the night in the inn. Sarya has a conversation with Shava and gets some more insight on her. Regarding Jenga, Shava says "realistically, I serve her, until I die or she kicks the bucket." And while she doesn't think Jenga's a bastard, she does think Jenga has weird priorities. She feels like she owes Jenga for saving her from Bureizu who definitely wanted to kill her, and also is well aware of Jenga's crush on her. Her opinion of Sarya has improved.

Yri tells Jenga about how he fought in a war against wood elves and that's why he hates them. He shows her the notches carved on the blade of his rapier, one for each wood elf he killed. Jenga is a bit disturbed by this. 

The next day, the party keeps travelling and gets to a small castle a little ways up a mountain. They are recieved by a tall human woman with bright red hair that has a gold streak in it, and similarly colored eyes. She wears a very function dress, and is around the Duchess' age, though maybe younger. She is [[Baroness Pendra|Baroness Pendra Feudrick]]. She will be the one to teleport the party back to Amberstead. 

She asks the party if they could help with a problem of hers. She became the baron of this land almost 5 years previously. The previous baron was not popular and had been thrown out. Baroness Pendra rooted out a green dragon in the area and while its last two lairs were knocked out, it's continued to elude them and is now deep in the woods. She shows the party, from a balcony, a spot several miles to the south, where the Autumnwood gives way to green trees for a while. She will lend the party 6 archers if they agree to help. 

The party agrees. Jenga shows the baron her pendant, the one with [[Sybil Eisner]]'s name on it. Pendra says that [[Margrave Eisner]] is the lord of [[Burgmarch]], and Sybil is his adopted daughter. She was a kobold and back when Margrave Eisner with the adventuring partner of the current high king, they found her as an abandoned infant in their travels and they raised her.
J: "Haz, can you tell us about this?"
Haz: "Me no know much about Wears-Many-Scales. Very not mean, but also not from pack."
J: "Did she come from somewhere else?"
Sarya: "How did Jenga meet you?"
Haz: "We meet in mine. Me surrender. Old tribe do raiding, town not like raiding, so town raid kobold. Me surrender, me go away."
