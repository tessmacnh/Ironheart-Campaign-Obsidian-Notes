The party reunites and safely loots the rest of the jars. 

The party finds a pond of sewer water with something inside, in the grasp of a skeleton. It's a rod of some sort. Larry thinks it's a magic item, since in big cities like those in the [[Bernato Alliance]] sewer systems are used to transport magic items to avoid robbery. Finnwell identifies it as an immovable rod.
The party struggles to obtain it until Gimbal suddenly remembers that he has Mage Hand, which he uses to finally retrieve the rod.

The party then finds a very clean room that soon obviously contained gelatinous cubes. Gimbal kills two of them and bravely pulls through his panic. 
In the loot, Jenga finds +3 leather armor that has changable embroidery on it.
