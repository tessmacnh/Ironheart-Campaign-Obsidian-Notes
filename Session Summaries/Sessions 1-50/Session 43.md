The party finds some rooms that they loot. Yri gets armor that lets him understand abyssal. 

The party fights yochlols, one of them is disguised to look like Shava but isn't. They also fight armanites(?), demon centaurs that throw lightning.

After a long rest the party goes to the portal room, having picked up the stones that grant passage through the ward. The room beyond is lit by the glow of a massive pane of planar energy on the far end, and the walls are dotted with geodes of cat eye gemstones. In the center is a large fiend with a snake-headed tail, beastish head, and deadly axe, accompanied by 4 smaller insectoid fiends. It roars, "YOU DARE TO INTERFERE IN THE PLANS OF MY MASTER???"

The fight begins. Bureizu gets turned into a frog at once point. Yri is knocked out. Finnwell gets enlarged but that ends up being dispelled, and eventually, Finnwell gets decapitated with a blow of the axe.
Yri wakes from unconsciousness on a crit success and cuts its head off.
Gimbal is angry and finishes the last bug fiend.

The party grieves for Finnwell but have more important issues. They learn that the only way to close the portal is for someone living to enter it from their side. Bureizu declares himself the one best suited to survive Hell. He gives Flies to Jenga, as well as his money when she asks, and with a final, very emotional farewell to the party, Buriezu steps through the portal, and it snaps shut.
