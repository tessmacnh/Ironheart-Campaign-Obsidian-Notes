Jenga receives a vision from her patron.

The next morning, Sarya finds that her pack as been gone through. There is a note written in Elvish, saying, `they lied`. No one in the party claims to have written it, and no one's handwriting matches it. 

The party continues their travels. Haz is working on something in the cart. He tells Jenga he is making 'moon water.'
"Big shiny man say you no have drink, so me make you drink."
Jenga winks and gives him a thumbs-up.
The day goes on. There are a few more days of travel to go before the final point of interest before the territory of Baroness Pendra. The terrain gets firmer as the party continues, and less marshy. 

When the sun has almost set, the party sees a rowboat with no passenger drifting down the river. Bureizu summons Bureitwo to investigate the boat. Among the rubble in it is a prone horse that seems to be almost intentionally covered in rubble and debris. The boat comes to a rest upon the shore.
A hand shoots up. Covered in rubble, a humanoid stands up, and a familiar voice calls out.
"Ain't this a coincidence?"
[[Levius Edwards|Levius]] is here, in studded armor with a hand crossbow and a rapier. The members of the party who were present when he saved them a while back from wolves are thrilled to see him again, and vouch for him for the rest of the party. He warns the party that the woods ahead is infested with ettercaps, near-humanoid spider-like creatures. He says they can go through the water, which can be dangerous, or the woods, which is also dangerous. He offers to lead us through the woods, since he's been paid to deal with the ettercaps. Bureizu gives Jenga a lecture on not doing dumb shit (ie. shooting fire in a forest of flamable web) and the party sets up camp for the night on the edge of the woods. 

Several ettercap show themselves during the watches but don't bother the party. Haz gives Jenga a potion bottle of amber liquid, his [[Haz's Moonshine|"Moonwater"]].

Jenga wakes Levius for his shift on watch and he stops her to talk for a moment.
J: "What's up?"
L: "Perchance... When did you meet your other elven friend?"
J: (checks her journal) "About 20 days ago, why?"
L: "20 days."
J: "Yeah, why do you ask?"
L: "I assume, then, you've also met a friend of mine?"
J: "That would depend on who a friend of yours is."
L: "I believe they're going by... Multiple names, comes with the biz, they go by [[Thiala]]. Are you aware of the Silver Key?" He pulls a pendant from his pocket, with the blade crossing the moon symbol of [[Eilistraee]]. Jenga remembers the same symbol on the note that led the party to the Silver Key in the sewers. The pendant in Levi's hand is glowing.
L: "It started glowing, and I noticed the hairpin."
J: "In that case, yeah, I'm aware of this friend of yours."
L: "I haven't done them jobs in a while but one is coming up, that's why I'm going this direction. Out of curiosity, under what circumstances did you meet Thiala?"
J: "We found an offer in Amberstead to find a drow kid in the sewers, it offered double money."
L: "Let me guess, they didn't pay you straight?"
J: (annoyed) "Yes."
L: "They offered more for the next job to cover what they didn't pay?"
J: "Exactly."
L: "Let's just say they do in fact pay after a while." He shows his enchanted mithril rapier. 
L: "I got this for helping run letters underground. And, not sure if you've looked at my crossbow- this is one of the finest works I've ever seen, and I mean, they took long enough to give it to me, but it's a nice bonus." The strings and bow are enchanted, and when he fires a shot, the string snaps taught with incredible force.
J: "Okay, that's cool."
L: "Yeah, they got nice items."
Jenga looks around as they talk and sees a trail of string around the camp.
J: "Levius, do you know what that is?"
L: "I cast an alarm spell around the camp. Look, even if you do it for the money, the Key are a bunch of good people, they pay you well if you consistently work with them. That's my recommendation. You get some rest, I'll keep watch to morning as we agreed on."

Morning comes on the 39th of Springtide. Jenga is out of rations so she goes foraging and nearly gets lost, she ends up sharing jerky with Levius. 
The party is ambushed by ettercaps immediately upon entering the woods. Even once passing that, they trigger a web trap and have to fight again. Sarya reminds Jenga again not to use fire spells. 
Jenga scouts for traps and finds a cart snared in webbing. The party loots it for some rope and valuables. They then come to a split in the road. Gimbal and Shava split up to scout, and while Gimbal returns reporting another cart, Jenga could have sworn she heard a trap activating from Shava's path. The party fights their way down that path and find two humanoid shapes wrapped in web. Jenga cuts down Shava from one of them and gives her a health potion. Shava feels like she failed, but Jenga assures her that it was just a poor decision to split the party. 

After a short rest, the party loots the cart Gimbal found and find another one shortly after. Yri thinks it is similar to carts used to transport prisoners. There are 4 bodies of elves inside, their fingers in tatters and scratch marks on the walls. The cart was clearly intentionally abandoned. Jenga breaks their shackles and arranges them neatly on the floor of the cart before re-locking it. She sees a shimming continuously on the edge of her vision, one the others cannot see, but as she follows it, it leads them to the exit of the woods, and she suspects it may be a spirit of one of the elves she put to rest.
