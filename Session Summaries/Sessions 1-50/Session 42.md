Bureizu gets a [[Sunblade]] from the paladins to borrow. Clarity warns the party about water demons and their immunities.

Jenga has a dream from her patron in which he shows her a path to the portal the party is trying to close. It is blocked by a ward, passable by holding a certain stone that the pig-demons killed previously had with them. He also shows her a room with a stone in it that he wants her to get, but not until the main portal is closed.
He also warns her that her new bracers are indeed cursed and there is no perfect way of fixing them. He also implies that he will meet her party soon.

Jenga tells the party about the dream, and the party continued killing demons as they progress through the mines. There are some very annoying ones that cast heat metal on anyone wearing metal armor.
