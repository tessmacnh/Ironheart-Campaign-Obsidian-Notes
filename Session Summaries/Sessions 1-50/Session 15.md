(I think I as notetaker missed the front part of this session)

While exploring the town, Gimbal finds a strange logbook. None of the doors are on their hinges, it seems like they have all been forced open. 

Jenga finds nice wine under the counter in an inn. Also finds a damaged ledger. The last entry catches her eye. Instead of a name it just says 'elf' and their stay seems to have been terminated. (It was an indefinite stay with the rent fee noted to have been paid by the mayor)

The logbook Gimbal found is damaged in areas but reads:
`Elf... disbanded... trial... safe return... conscript... elf... burning... difficult`

Most places the party explores have been ransacked, looted for valuables. Door frames are damaged like something too big went through them.
Finnwell finds a desk with paperwork and looks through it.
There is a flier detailing an execution.
`The burning of the witch who has invaded the town takes place on [a year about 5 years previously]. Do not bring your children, do not bring your elders.`

The town square looks like a storm came through. Some furniture barricading a door has blood on it. We open a locked steel safe and get lots of money.

In a meeting room, Finnwell finds some papers. One is noting down expenses. It list a silver for rent, times 7 for a week's stay. 21 coppers for meals and drinks. A small allowance for clothing and such. Circled is a request for a high number of bandages and a large quantity of bonemeal, noted as being from 'any animal'.

Jenga notes that the handwriting seems panicked upon the writing of 'bonemeal' but calmer at the following note.
Why would a traveller want several pounds of bonemeal?

The party finds a record of a town meeting. The elf is again referenced.
`'Elf' 'offer' 'security' 'shelter'` A tally indicates this was voted in favor.
`'Elf' 'suspicion of [illegible]'` seems to be people in favor of banishment or execution, with more votes for execution. 
The end of the document lists the cost of a large amount of lumber, and something listed as 'tar'.

The next building has the same sort of barricading. Something caught in the doorframe is long and withered, sort of plant fiber, or a vine. Jenga notes she has heard of spells and monsters that can invoke the power of plants.

Jenga finds some coins as well as a small fabric doll of an elf with green hair, and a sad smile. She keeps it. 

There is a yelp as they leave. Shava and Haz are together. Jenga asks if they are good. Shava says she thought she saw something on the edge of her vision. Gymmy had also seen something flickering in his vision earlier. Shava says she didn't see a figure moving but thought she saw someone standing nearby.

Gymmy later again sees something at the edge of his torchlight, some sort of hooded figure.

The party finds a classroom of sorts. Yri sees movement at the edge of his sight, something not much taller than an animal.
There is a nursery sort of room with rotting toys. Documents in an office confirm that this is a schoolhouse. There is a well preserved handwritten note.
`Principal. I am concerned about how this newcomer is spending so much time with the children. While he does not have clear ill intent, I do not trust him.`
There is a reply that clearly never had the chance to be sent.
`I don't think the concern is warranted. He is unusual, to be sure, but he treats the children kindly. It's also the only time I've seen him smile. He does not bring his work with him, there is no need to be concerned.`

The party loots some small wood carvings from a carpenter's workshop. The next building has a symbol of [[Bahamut]], and the entire place seems to be some sort of temple.
Shava flinches. She saw the same thing she did before, and Haz did as well, saying it was short but not in a 'little thing' way but a 'big thing crawling' way.

Yri detects undead nearby, but the source of it leaves. 

Gymmy and Jenga dismantle some shrines to the dragonlords and get pieces worth a fair bit of gold. Jenga sees a vaguely humanoid figure on all fours at the edge of her darkvision. The party decides to follow it.

Gymmy sees a pale glowing figure putting a hand up in warning. He tells the party but the party continues forward. They see a being on all fours. It stands and beckons them closer, saying "come," in Common. Jenga moves forward, we spot ghouls all around the path we're approaching. Combat starts.

The ghouls are looted when the fight ends. Larry suspects they weren't from the town and probably came at a later date. The ghast the party had been seeing was in officer's attire.

The looting of buildings continues. An official report is found, mostly damaged, but at the bottom it reads:
`Elf requested to not be buried. Request denied.`
We do know that powerful necromancers should not be buried, and suspect at this point that the elf is a necromancer who was sentenced to execution, and wasn't permitted an alternate means of having his body disposed.

The party finds a mausoleum covered in dried plant fibers like a massive plant was forced through the archway. Jenga loots every shiny she finds inside the mausoleum, which all total to about a 330 gold value. Finnwell sees vines around the back of the mausoleum's exterior. The sun is rising as the party finds a series of buds growing admist tombstones. These buds sit on bundles of roots, inside of which are many human remains. As they approach, the vines shift and a plant rises. This is a corpse flower, and sure enough, the buds begin to eject corpses of their own. These corpses begin to rise.
