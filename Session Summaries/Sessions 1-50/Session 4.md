It is the 10th of Springtide.

The party's final day in Maplewood before they take the escort job for a caravan heading to [[Amberstead]]. 
After some shopping, the party meets with the merchants, Gimbal helps them find the way. It's a crew of humans, dwarves, halflings, and gnomes. [[Elden Fastfood]] is the head of their crew.
The party brings the captured ambush drake with them and get a cart to carry it in.
Elden says the bandits are pretty bad, and he wants to talk to the Duke about it. (The party at this time does not know who the duke is, but Elden is referring to [[Duchess Eloise Amberleaf]].


The group travels uninterrupted for 4 days. It's the 14th now and they've been heading east for a while, until they encounter a fallen log blocking the road. It didn't seem to fall naturally, so it's likely a trap.

Bandits attack the party. The fight is hard. Gymmy is pissed, kills one by cutting their head off with his spiritual weapon. Gymmy also is seen taking their teeth and eyes from the dead bodies, which grosses everyone out. Gimbal is in shock after the fight. Jenga and Haz try to slap him out of it.
