The ghost (in Jenga's body, of course) picks the lock to the cell but doesn't yet open the door. 

The party upstairs is debating what to do. They decide to wait until after the next battle to tell Jenga that Haz died and came back. They sneak back downstairs, ready to fight again. They dispatch the myrmadons and Bureizu tells Jenga what happened. The ghost responds by embracing Haz, asking if he is alright, and Yri apologizes for dropkicking Jenga, but also tells her not to steal.

Ghost!Jenga goes to get the mithril chain shirt from under the bed and gives it to Haz along with an enchanted crystal dagger. Sarya tries to trade him for the armor but he refuses. The party makes a point of agreeing to distribute loot in the future.

While Sarya talks to Larry about crafting with the pelts of the displacer beasts, the ghost takes Jenga's body to a bell at the end of the hall and rings it. The 5 remaining cell doors open and ghosts emerge, to the party's dismay. The fight temporarily ages Finnwell by 30 years and Gimbal by 20. The ghost in Jenga cannot use magic, so Jenga throws knives at the ghosts, which makes the party suspicious. 

When pressed for details, the ghost is purposefully vague, mentioning that they (Jenga) are a warlock, and they don't have their powers at the moment, but they have to kill the being at the top of the keep. The party buys it hook line and sinker, and believe that killing the person in the keep will let Jenga get her powers back. 

The party gets elven wine. 

The party fights more animated guards of various sorts, and loots some barracks. After another fight against some helmed horrors, the party takes a long rest.

The strong folks kick down the door to the final room. On a throne is a set of armor, with human remains in it. This is the man the ghost wants to kill, and possible the man Zil mentioned knowing. 

Yri does divine sense and senses undeath coming from the remains- But also from Jenga. The ghost says that whatever is holding back her powers may be affecting her, and the party decides to deal with it after killing the captain of the keep. 
The fight is hard. Bureizu goes down. Yri dies (again) and sarya gos down. Bureizu gets up again and goes down again. Sarya gets temporarily banished to the feywild. Finally at one point in the fight, Jenga is knocked out, and the ghost leaves her, possessing Haz. Gymmy revives Yri, who kills the Death Knight. Shava heals Jenga. Now normal again and very pissed, Jenga blasts the ghost. Gymmy gets the final blow on the ghost but not before it possesses Shava as well. Finally, the fight is over and everyone is stable and alive.

The party levels up to level 7!
