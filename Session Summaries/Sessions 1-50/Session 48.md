The party fights off some approaching zombies and encounter a woman named Lunima who teleports on the boat asking the party to not kill her. She explains that there are people living on the island. She casts a spell to protect the boat (as an abjuration wizard) and tells the party that they are on [[Isle Boros]]. It's home to some nagas, humanoids, zombies, and a cult. There are deathlocks on the island, and a lich who leads the cult, and probably made the storm.

Lunima was 12 when her parents came to the island while sailing. She was below decks as all those above were turned into zombies. She survived on the island for 6 years, being tutored in abjuration magic by the nagas and others.

Lunima opens a portal to the settlement she is from. There are the damaged remains of what was once a great city. At the far end of the street the party sees a large serpentine figure, a naga friend of Lunima's, named [[Zitoyna]]. 
They bring us to 'the Speaker' who is a naga named [[Ritora]] (I think, my notes are a tad unclear). In a remains of a palace there is a round room with 7 spirit nagas.

Ritora: "I am Ritora. Greetings, outsiders. I assume the young pupil of our kin informed you of our plight?"
Party: "Yeah."
Ritora: "Long ago, we claimed this island as a refuge for those who needed it. Of course, it served its purpose as a kingdom for the (host??) for many years under our protection, but eventually we made a mistake. We decided not to pry into the history of any who came here to preserve their comfort. That led us to accidentally letting in an individual with more nefarious purpose. The individual, who identifies themself as Limos, came here with a large number of followers claiming to be persecuted for their beliefs. Indeed, that persecution was cause they were necromancers who studied the means to end a naga permenantly. Under normaly conditions, if a naga is slain, we return no more than six days later. Very little can interrupt that, only the affects of a Wish can, or by transforming us into undead abomination known as bone naga."
Ritora shows signs of sorrow.
Ritora: "We do not bear child often. There used to be far more of us. What you see here, plus five or so more, are all the naga who remain. In any case, the young pupil of our kin here has decided to do her best to eventually drive out this lich and end their encapsulation of this island. We have done out best to teach her. She has derived all she knows from the spirit naga. In any case, we would be deeply in your debt and you would be able to leave freely if the lich were destroyed. Limos has plagued the island for far too long."

The party decides to kill the lich. They prepare by making holy water molotovs, 12 bottles.

When leaving, the party is stopped by the Speaker.
"Before you depart, student of our kin, there is one gift I wish to give you. Come with us."
The party and Lunima goes with, and the Speaker performs a coming of age Ceremony for her.

The party heads out and fights zombies and deathlocks as they head through the forest. Yri dies a THIRD TIME but is revived by Clarity.
