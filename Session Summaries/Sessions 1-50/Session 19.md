Seems to be at least 100 men if not more. The soldiers at the outpost hold fire until it is time. The enemy clear did not expect the outpost to have working artillery. They begin to charge the outpost. Arrows shoot at the outpost. Haz is knocked out by one off the bat but is healed by Shava.
Jenga takes out a few number of individuals with a fireball, but then takes many magic missiles in retaliation from the battle mages. She goes down. Shava stabilizes her after Haz fails to.

A soldier next to Jenga is hit and falls. Shava goes to heal him but Jenga shakes her head, not wanted to waste supplies she could use on her allies instead of strangers. Jenga later goes down again.
Larry is also out, Finnwell goes down, Captain Vahlen goes down but recovers. Gymmy tells Shava, who left the room, that he hasn't seen any spells coming from where Jenga is in a while. Shava and Haz freak out, Shava heals Jenga. 

The battle shifts as the enemy forces are taken down. They begin to retreat. The commander nearly escapes but Larry shoots down both the horse and its rider.

25 prisoners were taken.
When Captain Vahlen discovers that Jenga didn't allow a dying soldier to be healed, when they were in a medbay (which Jenga wasn't aware of), Jenga is kicked out of the outpost and not allowed a share of the loot from the battle.

Larry and Gimbal try to interrogate the prisoners.

Prisoner: "We were paid to attack- Well, paid to protect, but we both saw how well that went. If you really want to know I was going to say, I could tell you something about my boss."
Larry: "What's up with him?"
Prisoner: "Figured he was cheated out of some noble position or something like that. Not stuff I'm paid to know. Took a job, we were campign further west, he told us to come here. We crossed the river, then crossed the river again."
(Perhaps originally from Amberstead side of the river?)

Larry and Gimbal are not good at being intimidating and their threats of removing a man's beard are not effective at all.

Captain Vahlen says the enemy marched in from the west, which is the direction we are going in. They made most of their march on the Firham side of the river.
The party gets to stay in the outpost, but Gimbal sneaks out to go find Jenga, who's made camp with Haz in the clearing.

J: "You ain't fooling no one, I see you."
G: "Uh, ok, well..."
J: "If you're here to punch me, I probably deserve it."
G: "No, I- I dunno, I feel bad for you, I mean, I dunno what happened but I... I heard something about something you did mking a guard die but you must have had a good reason?"
J: "I thought I did. No one else did."
G: "Well I think it probably could've ended differently but I think everyone else is taking it out too hard on you."
J: "Thanks, Gimbal."
G: "I wanted to give you this."
Gimbal gives Jenga studded leather armor, and 5 days of rations.
J: "You can keep the armor, mine is better. I'll take the food, though. Thanks."
She ends up giving the armor to Haz.
J: "Is Shava alright?"
G: "I think I saw her in the hallway, I dunno, it's hard for me to tell how she's feeling."
J: "I feel that, man. Fuck, people are confusing."
G: "I believe in you."
J: "That's the most Imma get so... thanks. Also... I'm sorry for kicking you awake on watch all the time, that's kinda shitty of me."
G: "I should go."

As he leaves, there is a snap in the woods, but Jenga thinks nothing of it. When it happens again, she moves back with Haz, as three carrion crawlers emerge from the woods. The two of them book it, and Jenga starts screaming. They start to fight as they run when Gimbal, hearing them, returns to help. Gimbal kills the final one, and with each stab of the dagger he yells, "Jenga's still my friend!"

Gimbal bumps into Captain Vahlen on the way back and explains he was worried about Jenga.
She comments, "that's fine, it's not a crime or anything. I just don't care for people who are okay with sitting idly by while people die. Suppose it's big talk for a commander of some backwater fort but it's true none the less."
Gimbal says, "I think it's noble. I mean, you help stop forces from far outside invading the people inside. You're the first ones to protect people who can't fight for themselves."
Vahlen: "I suppose. Things is, this isn't a border that tends to see that action. Today was an exception, not the rule. Yes [[Miller]] is fucking dead. And I can't bring him back, can I? I don't think your friend can either. You're free to go to your quarters."

Jenga has another dream from her patron that night. It basically amounts to 'girl what the fuck are you doing?' He also tells her that the party is approaching some wood elven ruins that she may find interesting.
