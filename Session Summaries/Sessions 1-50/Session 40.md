The party continues to find underground water turned red. They fight some flying demons with the help of a sabertooth tiger named [[Fluffy]] summoned by Sarya. 

The party gets some loot from an island in the red water.
- Bracers of the Illusionist
- Aura of Life scroll
- Chime of Opening
- Cat eye gems
- 1090 copper, 161 electrum

Jenga casts Tiny Hut and during the rest, attunes to the bracers. They let her fire double the amount of eldritch blast by recasting it (or any cantrip) on a bonus action, but they deal necrotic damage straight to her (bypassing temp hp) when she casts a cantrip, as well as insult her in her mind with words such as 'devilspawn.'

Jenga asks Kari why they do that. Kari says they are related to the Blood War, made in the Abyss for combat against devils. Thus the negative affects only impact devils or people associated with devils.
The party picks up on this, combined with the fact that Jenga is a warlock. They question whether she has sold her soul to a devil and while Jenga denies it at first, Sarya sees through the deception. Jenga says they can discuss it when they aren't in a mine full of demons. 

More fighting happens. This entire dungeons is just lots of fighting demons. The party tracks footprints and finds Shava's armor and clothing split down the front but empty. Jenga retrieves her items.
They find yellow slime and webbing leading away from the area.

After fighting some demon frog things, Jenga sees through a door a trio of dark skinned humanoids walking east, carrying something wrapped in silk.
