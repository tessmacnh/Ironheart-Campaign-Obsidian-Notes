The party makes camp. Gymmy forages. Shava goes hunting. The party proceeds and finds a large object blocking the road. It's green/blue in color and seems to be the remains of several trolls fused together, now dead. Jenga sees a large weighed down sack on its shoulder and tries to take it, but it's too heavy. As she and Finnwell try to get it, a massive insectoid creatures crawls up the corpse from the other side and perches on top, hissing.

During the fight, some more show up. Gymmy goes unconcious at one point and when he gets back up he has Dragon's Breath effect on him, and he breathes acid over one of the insectoids. Towards the end of the fight Gimbal kills one and is in shock for five minutes. A few more bugs cause trouble but the fight eventually concludes. Yri insists that these are 'ground whales' but Larry says he is wrong, these are ankhegs. Jenga loots the bag that the troll-thing had. Shava shows up with a deer she had caught. It secures the party 8 days of rations.
