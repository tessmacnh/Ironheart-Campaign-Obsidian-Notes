Before sending the party off, the Baroness tells them everything she knows. It is a fully mature green dragon, who manipulated the previous baron under its control to gather treasure and members of its living hoard. It's wily, but backed into a corner. The forest around its domain grants it eyes and ears everywhere. There is a maze of thorny thickets and vines around the trees. Once it was in the mountains but now that it's in the Autumnwood, it's position is obvious. She will send 7 arches and half a dozen soldiers with the party. The dragon breaths poison and is capable of swimming, so they should beware bodies of water.

The party stops by the [[Westmill Apothecary|apothecary]] for antidote. 
Back at the castle, there are 7 archers. Most are human but one is a half wood elf in regalia. He introduces himself as [[Fiven Arnold]], captain of Westmill Guard.

Larry teaches the soldiers, as well as Haz and Shava, how to use the cannon on their cart. The group approaches the woods, and eventually the trees are no longer orange but vibrant green, and an emerald mist hangs in the air. The trees are bound with thickets of thorny plants, blocking any vision for 10 feet up. The party decides to cut through them instead of traversing the maze, so Gimbal, Gymmy, Yri, and Bureizu work on cutting through.

The air is green and it is uncomfortable to breath. The party has yet to see an animal large than a skunk. Barely past noon, the party finally cuts through the plants into a small clearing where there is a gash in the ground, like a dragon struck something there. The party debates whether or not to use the [[Dragon-touched Bell|bell]], and while Sarya refuses, Gimbal stealthily rings it.

Materializing behind the party is [[Verzilverd]]. He agrees to help the party, and speaks to Sarya outside the party's earshot. 

Zil: "What are you hoping to discuss?"
Sarya: "I know the favor was used, but I have a predicament."
Z: "You signed off to attack something bigger than you can swallow?"
S: "No, I wanted to use the favor for something else. You've heard of the [[Copper Dragonlord]], yes?"
Z: "The Copper Dragonlord..."
S: "I have no easy to say this-"
Z: "You're not referring to Aeramen, were you?"
S: "Yes, to him, the immortal one or so the rumors say."
Z: "I'm not sure she's immortal. Old, though, aged well mind you. Oldest thing I'm aware of that isn't gone."
S: "It's a rumor I'm chasing. It's most likely a true not. Not immortal by means of like killing it but- That's besides the point."
Z: "Do you intend to slay her?"
S: "NO, not in the slightest."
Z: "Fair. It was poorly spoken, that's all."
S: "I seek to gain an audience with this dragon."
Z: "Alright."
S: "There were two ways I had in mind, maybe you have connections with her-"
Z: "I'm aware of her existence but I don't live near that part of the world, I have no excuse to be there."
S: "I'm also willing to pursue the avenue of becoming a... a draconic sorcerer of some sort? I dunno if it's something you can do. Do you have info on how to become one?"
Z: "The primary way to be the descendent of a dragon. It's not outside my capabiltiies to give you a taste of my power but that's a little more than a favor."
S: "Fair point. I'm curious if there is anything I can do- Make a deal, do a favor for you- In order for you to do that?"
Z: "I'll let you know if anything comes up."
S: "I have a sending stone, can you use it to contact-"
Z: "No, the spell is not one and done. Let me take a choice piece from this hoard and we will renew the favor I owe you. We should return to the others, now."
S: "We should."

Jenga and Fiven talk about wood elves. His dad was a defector from the military the wood elves have, was in town for the night and left in the morning. 

In the next clearing, the party finds a large blue snake, faintly breathing. It says "ensnared" in Common and then starts to grow in size, sprouting arms and legs. The party fights the yuan-ti, Haz enjoys using the cannon. During a rest afterwards the party is ambushed by green kobolds, one of whom surrenders and thus survives. They describe the dragon as big, green, and sneaky. He isn't able to tell us much about the dragon's minions. Jenga tries to talk to it but it's scared of her because of her fireball that killed 8 kobolds at once.
His name is [[Shines-In-Sun]]. He gets put in the cart with Zil.

The party gets to a big clearing with a pond of water fed by a waterfall. Jenga asks Shines-In-Sun if there is a cave on the other side of the waterfall, and he nods. She shoots an eldritch blast through it and there is a deafening roar. The party scatters into position.

The fight begins as kobolds pour from the sides of the waterfall, and then there is a figure under the surface of the waterfall. Bursting from the water is a massive green dragon. The martials begin to fight yuan-ti. Zil spits out a crumpet and shifts into his silver dragon form, surging towards the green dragon, [[Viridus]]. The archers keep firing and Haz mans the cannon. The green dragon keeps knocking Zil down, but he's also looking rough. Jenga accidently fireballs Yri while he's unconcious. Bureizu also goes down at one point. 
The dragon eventually tries to retreat back into its lair. Sarya yells "COWARD!" at it and it instead drops into the water. Larry enlarged Zil.
Finally, Gimbal goes down and is pinned under the dragon's claws. Finnwell, upset at seeing his friend in danger, attacks the dragon, his longsword ablaze with green flame, and kills it. The dragon collapses into the water. 

The party struggles but eventually dispatches the last of the kobolds, yuan-ti, and broodguard. The assembled soldiers and party celebrate Finnwell's kill, chanting 'Dragonslayer!'

The party gets to loot the hoard! As his pick, Zil takes a gold statuette set with green gemstones. Finnwell is given the next pick. When the party finishes looting the cave, they exit to find Zil gone, along with Shines-In-Sun.
