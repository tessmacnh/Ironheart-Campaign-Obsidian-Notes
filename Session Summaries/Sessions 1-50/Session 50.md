Jenga tells the party what she found. Larry makes a guess that the woman was sacrificed to feed the lich's phylactery. The party encounters some fake bridges and accidently summon a large Bigby's Hand they have to fight. 

In a crypt area full of coffins, Jenga does Detect Magic and warns the party that the coffins all have necromancy magic on them. The party fucks with the coffins anyway and zombies, skeletons, and deathlocks emerge. 

Sarya uses a contingency of her contract but it doesn't work, the area is warded against interplanar travel. The party tries to make a retreat. Haz refuses to leave until Jenga does. Haz is killed, and shortly after, Jenga is as well.

Suddenly, every wight with a weapon puts it away and enter a kneeling stance. The zombies meander away. Sarya tries to revive Jenga but it is counterspelled by an approaching robed figure.
"Surrender, and we shall merely take you into custody."
Sarya goes unconscious, and Finnwell surrenders.
