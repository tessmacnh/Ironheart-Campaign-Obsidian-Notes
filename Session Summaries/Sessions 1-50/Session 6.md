The 17th of Springtide.

The party is outside the magic shop.
Gimbal knows of an inn in the city, simply called [[Andri's]], named after the barkeep [[Andri]]. Jenga's go-to is [[The Bumbling Bugbear]] and Larry and Bureizu know of [[Bed-and-Kettle]] near the tri-market.

The group picks Andri's. It is run by Andri, a tall spotted tabaxi (female).
Gimbal talks in private a bit with Andri.
Gymmy is once again cryptic and mentions having debts to pay. 

The party evesdrops on some larger folks talking at the corner table.
1: "You know any recent jobs, I'd love to do something else."
2: "I hears the duke is organizing an expedition up north to the unclaimed areas of the Autumnwood. Lots of nasties in those woods, though. (??) don't like that duke."
1: "It'll be a change of pace. Hope she's hiring guards, though."
2: "Well, dock work is dock work, and they're not departing for another month at the very least."

Haz revealed he is around 80 moons old- about 6 and a half, mature for a kobold.

The party gleans some information about [[Firham]]. It's got evergreen forests and a lumber industry. Supposedly the Duchess of Amberstead and the Count of Firham are tense for some reason.

On the 18th, Andri wakes the party. Bureizu and Gimbal had found a concealed paper in the Guard Headquarters, offering a job with some coded instructions to follow. The party tries to decipher the instructions but has difficulty until Larry noted that the illustration on it, of a sword over a circle, resembles a compass. 

The party reaches a grate to the sewers. Vopina stayed behind, as she had recieved a summons from the Duchess to meet. The rest of the party headed down. They meet a female drow named [[Cyla]], who works for a group called [[The Silver Key]].

She explains that there is a 'VIP' in the sewers who is being persued. She gives Bureizu a pendant that will glow in the presence of drow. We gather that some drow are allies, but the drow not part of the Silver Key are enemies.

The party travels through the sewers. They fight some jellies and Gimbal is still panicked in fights.
