The party travels through wet and foggy weather. They make some conversation with Morrowzeer. The Silver Key tells them to not draw suspicion on the road. They will pass a town in Amberstead (the duchy), and then pass a town in Cliffshire before they reach Masonport. 

The party travels through the night, some of them sleeping in the cart. Jenga asks Thiala what's up with Lia.
T: "Let's just say she's a... How much do you know of Lolthites and their religion?"
J: "They worship a goddess named Lolth?"
T: "Our little friend here was an incumbent priestess who heard the song before her initiation."
J: "That's something to do with your goddess?"
T: "Hearing the song is what we call those who see flaws in the way of Lolth. She recognized that she had been lied to and wanted out. The song guided her to us, and to you. It was hard keeping them off her back in the Underdark, and it's continued being damned hard up here. I don't know who she was the favorite little subject of to have them hot on our heels, but it's made things difficult, which is why we need the help of those like you."

Jenga seeks relationship help from Heian.
H: "Advice from my personal experience... Romantic love tends to be hard to cultivate if you're forcing them into it. Some people are into it, but make sure she's aware that she's not your consort."
Jenga explains that nothing is being forced, and she even went on a date with Shava (even if it was an awkward one). Heian comments, "I may have been more worried than I should have been. Just give her time. Time is the best solution, things either resolve themselves or reveal themselves to be the wrong path to take in the first place."

The party does not sleep the next night. As the next day comes to a close, the party arrives at [[Woodpost]], which marks the end of the Autumnwood. After they leave, they will go northeast to Cliffshire. The path southeast, if they took it instead, would go to [[Brazenhold]]. 

They go to an inn, [[The Silver Gate]]. While some of the party sleeps inside, others take watch over the cart.

Sunrise, on the 59th, the party proceeds. They finally leave the Autumnwood and find themselves in open plain. Following the upwards slope, they enter the region of [[Cliffshire]]. Heian says there is the option of taking the inland road or going along the cliffs. While the cliffs has bad weather, there's less towns to worry about passing. The party chooses to take that route. 

The ground is covered in dense bramble and rocks and stone. It's not ideal for farming but there are some settlements in the area. Jenga sees some spears poking from the bushes and alers the party of the bandits. They are easily defeated and one is captured. Jenga interrogates her to learn that the bandits only were here because they were low on money. Jenga takes the bandit's drugs and sends her on her way. 

Night falls again. The party gets a good view the next morning of the [[Iron Sea]] as they travel along the cliffline. They also see a bronze dragon flying along the horizon. A storm starts to brew offshore.

The next day, as it gets dark, a massive spider construct starts climbing the cliffs. Heian and Thiala say it is a retriever, sent by the lolthites to get Lia. Lolthites fight alongside it and the fight is difficult. Towards the end, the retriever bites Heian, and then both it and Heian vanish as it shifts planes. Thiala screams. Jenga realizes that she should have countered the spell but it's too late. The retriever returns only to vanish with the one lolthite the party managed to capture.
