The Ironhearts pick up Shava and return to the estate.
The awakened shruh that Haz bought (session 5) is finally awake! It's a little berry bush on rooted feet. It says, "I am plant" and thus is dubbed [[Plant the Plant]]. Jenga teaches it every curse word she knows. Plant is capable of producing goodberries.

Bureizu wants to buy some necklaces, so the party gathers together money for that.

Over the next night, Jenga gets a dream from her patron. She is told that the party will soon have an opporunity to head north again.

The next morning 2 letters arrive, carried by [[Finnius]], one of Jenga's contacts.

The first letter has abjuration magic on in. The party opens it and it is written in code. Gimbal can't read, but uses the [[Dagger of the Envoy]] to read and decode it. 
`Position compromised. Moving soon. Need escort. Will pay well.` With the symbol of Eilistraee at the bottom and a date corrosponding to the 55th of Springtide.

The second one is on high quality paper with a border design, sent from the Gilderlook.
`Dear Ironhearts and Drakesbane Finnwell,`
`Your presence has been requested to attend meeting on the 49th of Springtide to discuss findings of expeditions in addition to plans moving forward as to security arrangement of city of Amberstead. You are all expected to attend. The meeting will be held at noon in the Gilderlook. Please arrive at least an hour early to accommodate for any necessary procedure, and come well dressed.`
It is signed by Duchess Eloise Amberleaf. Jenga spots something odd in the filigree design around the border and examines it held up to the light. Concealed in the border is writing.
`Bring weapons.Be subtle about it. We suspect danger.`
There is an Elven signing rune that Larry recognizes to be that of the investigator.

The party prepares to conceal their weapons and the next day, on the 49th, they meet with Drusilla who leads them to a meeting room in the Gilderlook. She goes to talk to Sarya and returns without her. She also insists that Finnwell sit next to the Duchess. 
There are other nobles here, including [[Lupian Crimsonleaf]] and [[Baroness Pendra]]. [[Moili]] the guard is here as well. Yri sees someone nearby with the Firham crest on their badge, and Jenga thinks she sees the Baron of Maplewood.
The meeting starts with the Duchess speaking.

"Alright, if everyone is prepared I shall begin the meeting. Transcribers, you may begin writing our words down. As you are all most likely aware, the band of adventurers known as the Ironhearts preformed an expedition into the northern regions of the Autumnwood to scout out preiously identified fortifications and check up on the settlement of [[Silent Settlement|New Haven]]. As they returned, I have reports. 

First, it appears New Haven was attacked and abandoned. That experiment failed, we cannot 	attempt to settle towns in the Autumnwood without a draconic patron and new troops. For one of the four potential sites, we have one arranged. For the other three we will need to identify some. 

The second most important thing that must be gotten out of the way: We had an attack on the (?) outpost. As you may be aware, our outpost at the border between Firham and Amberstead was assaulted by mercenaries masquerading as Firham troops. Thanks to reinforcement by the Ironhearts, we help the position and captured some mercenaries. [[Count Silgard]] was informed of the framing. He has sent an emmisary with the emblem of Firham to oversee this meeting. Speaking of oversights, the final note we must cover is the reorganization of the guard of Amberstead. The recent one was thrown out entirely due to incompotence."

The notable points as the meeting continues are as follows:
- The exedition to found new settlements in northern autumnwood is going ahead as planned, but with additional troops and the location of 3 draconic patrons.
- New Haven was a proto-type settlement for this expedition, with people settling without a patron in the hopes that one would come. We all know how that went.
- A settlement will be reestablished in New Haven. one will be set up near the [[Elding Outpost]], called South Elding, one will be at [[Silverkeep|Fort Sylbor]], and one may be set up around the elven ruins, or it could be just a temporary settlement for researchers.

The meeting moves on to the second objective, reestablishing the [[Amber Guard]].
Lupian is made the captain of the guard, to be in charge of security forces. This choice prompts some murmuring from the nobles, though there are two nobles who appear rather stoic.
Moili becomes the new assistant captain. 
The Duchess is going to implement a stricter policy about who is allowed in the Gilderlook.

A servant standing behind Baroness Pendra reaches for something. Bureizu notices and nudges Jenga to alert her. Jenga casts Message to Pendra.
"Someone behind you right now, really suspicious."
Pendra turns and the servant steps back, a drawn knife in their hands. A fight breaks out. An #assassination attempt is in progress. Most of the nobles flee, some stay to fight, the Duchess teleports away to a safe place. There are several assassins at the scene. These assassins are using the same [[Ring of the Spy|rings]] that the ones trying to kill Vopina were using. During the fight, an assassin with fireball beads blows a hole in the floor.

The Duchess teleports back when the fight is over.
"This confirms a suspicion of mine. There is a traitor in our midst."
