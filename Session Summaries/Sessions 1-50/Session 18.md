The party is slowly approaching the fort/trading post at the [[Sylbor River]]. Jenga offers Haz her old leather armor but he doesn't want it. Gimbal asks Finnwell why he's still travelling with the party after the drow mission, and Finnwell says he has his own goal he's trying to find.

The party is ambushed by a shambling mound that wraps vines around Finnwell. Its ability to grapple people make the fight tricky, and scares the shit out of Haz. Gimbal holds up well during the fight. Afterwards, Shava gets more supplies for healing potions. The party later passes a shambling mound eating a deer but it has no interest in them.

The party finally reaches the edge of the [[Autumnwood]], and pine trees are now in sight. Between the Autumnwood and these pine trees is a wide river with no visible bridge. To the west is a small palisade fort, an outpost. One the other far end of the large clearing, about a kilometer away, are some tents and banners. Finnwell recognizes the banners, since he's done mercenary work. These are banners of the army of [[Firham]], but they are missing a lot of details.

At the [[Elding Outpost|outpost]], the party meets [[Captain Vahlen]], who informs them of the situations. 

"Those banners appear to be that of the Count of Firham. I don't have any information to suggest that it's not his forces but in any case, they have sent us an order to surrender or face a siege. This fort has about 20 men, we are not equipped for a siege. We have supplies, perhaps enough to last, you took the fast route that took you a week to get here. Normally you have to circle around east of Amberstead to reach here. Do any of you have skill with mechanisms and gunpowder?"

Larry is shown the recent shipment of swivel guns and gunpowder. No one at the fort knows how to assemble them. He decides to put them together and train the soldiers to use them.

The rest of the party plans an infiltration of the enemy camp. Gimbal is definitely going, and Jenga wants to go as well, and bring Shava, when Shava tells her that she's not exactly subtle, and so it will be only Shava and Gimbal on the mission.

The two of them scout near the tents and find a human figure in chain armor keeping watch. Some people move back and forth between tents. Their uniforms are rather unmarked, no regalia. The big tent seems more fit for strategy to be discussed. Gimbal listens to two people inside.

Voice 1: "Has the surrender come in yet?"
Voice 2: "No."
1: "Well then they've still got a few hours. I'm sure we need not watch yet."
2: "We're not paid to sit and wait while the fortress gears up for an actual siege."
1: "We have more than twice as many men as them, there's no need to worry."
2: "I am worried. You reported the group that travelled there, they had a wagon, more supplies, and warriors, probably. They came up *that* road, you know what it's like."
1: "Should we call this off?"
2: "Not if you want to get paid."
1: "Yes, my lord."

The group also overhears some soldiers chatting.

1: "I'm still tired from watch earlier. Why are we attacking from this side? There's a good place for camp on the other side, then we wouldn't have had to raft across twice."
2: "Something about who its going to get pinned on. I wasn't paying attention at the meeting either, you know me."
1: "I suppose those banners are from some army or another, and we're supposed to be impersonating them... doesn't mean I'm not tired."
2: "Shut it. Rumor has it the surrender order is not coming, so we'll have to fight. Make sure your mace is polished."

By this point it becomes clear that someone is trying to frame Firham for attacking an Amberstead outpost. 

Shava says she hears some talking about keeping horses somewhere, and something called a trebuchet. She thinks they could go interfere with it. They kill some guards, and Shava says they should quickly kill the horses to avoid detection. Gimbal knows he might freak out so he gives his tinderbox to Shava ahead of time. Sure enough, he can't take the killing of the second horse, and as he is crying, Shava sets the trebuchet on fire, picks Gimbal up with a hand over his mouth, and dashes through the woods. 
When his affliction passes, Gimbal apologizes, but Shava says that she is the one who failed, and she should have considered the risks. Gimbal say they both succeeded, technically, but she shakes her head.

Larry sets up a total of 9 cannons. The soldiers are trained in how to use them

As the sun sets, a horn rings out, and troops approach.
