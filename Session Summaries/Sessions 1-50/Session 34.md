Thiala tells the party they are on the clock, and have 10 hours until dawn. There will be a second assault of the retriever. 8 of those 10 hours will be spent in a long rest, leaving 2 hours to prepare. The party brainstorms.

The party learns in this time that there was something called [[The Spider War]] and these retrievers are forged from distilled souls of demons in mechanical constructs. It is aware of the VIP's location.

Larry finds some magic scrolls that Heian had been using to ward the cart: 
Illusory Script, Alarm, Comprehend Language, Detect Magic, Identify, Tenserâ€™s Floating Disk, Unseen Servant, Feign Death (lvl 3), Tiny Hut (lvl 3).

Jenga gets coffee and pulls an all nighter to transcribe floating disk and tiny hut into her Book of Shadows. Larry uses the Scroll of Mighty Fortress that came from the green dragon hoard to make a large fortress that the party can shelter in. On the inside, Jenga casts tiny hut with the Lia inside of it.

Dawn rises. Thunder fills the air and dread sets in. The retriever does return, and attacks at the east wall. The wall starts to crumble. Haz and Gymmy go down. At once point in the fight a lolthite whispers something to Shava, and she reacts in a state of shock. 
Gymmy strikes his scythe on it, saying "listen mate, you suck, nobody loves you, and if you had spectral organs, no one would want to use them, so it's redundant."
Buriezu then cuts its limbs off, and Morrowzeer smacks a hammer against its head, and the retriever is dead.

The party also has some captured drow to interrogate. The first one is woken up after being secured.

J: (points knife at finger of the woman) "Why are you after the girl?"
Drow: "Orders."
J: "From who?"
D: "The house captain."
J: "What interest does your captain have in the girl?"
D: "If I had to guess, its on the order of a priestess of some sort. She's an escaped incumbent, that's the extent of what I know of the target."
J: "Are you under orders to target my friend here?" Referring to Shava.
D: "I'd not call her a target. And I would I tell you?"
J: "I'm holding the knife."
D: "Fair enough. I don't know, though."
J: "Was your operation involved in the Amberstead assassination attempts?"
D: "That happens as collateral to our local cooperative. If it was out initiative, I wasn't ifnormed of it. Not my area of expertise."
J: "Did you interfere with the tournament?"
D: "That outide my area of expertise and knowledge."
Jenga can tell she is full of bullshit and cuts off her ring finger.
D: "We had a spy at the fair. Not sure- at least one, maybe more. They were assessing the capabilities of several individuals. Including you lot. Figuring out how to pull several of you away. There was supposed to be two of you gone but you seem to be at almost full strength."
J: "Which two people?"
D: "The paladin we expected to get promoted. As for the bard, frankly, we had someone pull her off to go on a tour. Hecklers in the crowd to rile them up."
Morrowzeer stops her bleeding. Jenga asks about Heian's current status and the drow answers, "the boss wanted him."

Suddenly, Jenga is struck with a necrotic spell and finds that Morrowzeer was the one to hit her. Armored guards teleport in and the party realizes that Morrowzeer betrayed them! A fight breaks out. The people here are part of the [[Goldscale Inquisition]] and accuse us of working with chromatic dragons. Gimbal charms some of them with his flawless logic of them not having hard evidence. The fight ends with three of them running away. Haz gets Gauntlets of Ogre Strength when Morrowzeer is looted. They rip his mask off, showing a man with brown eyes and slightly curled black hair to his midneck. 

Jenga asks the drow again why the paladin and bard were targetted, and is told that they were easy to pull away. She then wakes the second drow, who was blinded in the fight.

J: "Why were you sent after us?"
Drow 2: "Orders from the house captain."
J: "Who's the house captain?"
D2: "Who are you? You're not the woman I spoke to earlier."
J: "What? Who?"
D2: "A beautiful woman with a rapier?"
J: "I don't understand. Were you in disguise at the tournament?"
Thiala: "Leave her alone. What did you see?"
D2: "A woman with a silver rapier, not wearing anything." They describe the avatar of Eilistraee. Thiala says they have heard the song and we will not kill them. The party then discusses how to kill the first one, who pleads for her life, but eventually Haz throws her off a cliff. 

Jenga asks Shava what the drow whispered to her. Shava said they gave an offer she refused, the price was too high, or the offer too low.
