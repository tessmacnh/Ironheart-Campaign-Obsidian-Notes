It is 1164, the 4th of Springtide.

We start in the town of [[Maplewood]], within the territory of the [[Autumnwood]] in the kingdom of [[Brazenfell]]. In a tavern there is a half wood elf, waiting. 
[[Jenga Squallsong]], who has light green skin, leather armor, and long auburn hair, half of which is put into small beaded braids.
3 people enter the tavern. 
[[Larry Vincent]], a mechanic sort of fellow with scruffy black hair.
[[Bureizu Uwe]], a man with tan skin and dark black hair, chain armor, katanas, and handaxes.
[[Gimbal]], a small figure in a tattered and patched outfit, a hood and mask covering his face. He's about 3 feet tall.

There is a commotion outside and then, entering as well, as a gnome with 3 gnomish retainers. 
[[Vopina Crimsonleaf]], light green skin and bright green eyes, blonde hair in a short undercut style.
Next to enter is [[Gymmy]], a halfling with a black cloak over a normal outfit. He has a religious looking book and concealed weapons.

These folks notice a board with some odd jobs on it.
1. Hiring escorts for a merchant caravan going to [[Amberstead]] at the end of the week
2. Wanted posters, without a picture, looking for a dark elf
3. Hiring adventurers to track down a bear bothering a nearby farm
4. Hiring fighters to deal with kobolds in a nearby abandoned mine, with anything found kept as payment
5. A hand scrawled note saying `dragons are in the woods. Will pay for proof. Bring sweets.`

The party gathers, introductions are made, and everyone decides to take the fourth job in the mines.

The group takes a northward road that crosses a bridge to get to [[Cliffbrook Mines]].

Along the way, they are ambushed by wolves. Many are knocked out right away. A dire wolf shows up, making things worse, but the group is rescued by a passing hunter, [[Levius Edwards]].

At the mine, the party fights many kobolds, claiming loot as they go. Eventually, a single kobold is captured after it surrenders.

Jenga and Vopina both want to question the kobold. Vopina scares it, so Jenga does the questioning. First she asks what the kobolds are doing in the mines.
"Here to attack travelers, get loot to give to [[Speaks-With-Drakes]], who gives to master."
When asked who this 'master' is the kobold said they are a "big red and scary dragon"
The group gets directions on how to proceed and is warned about a bug of some sort. It is also apparently "not safe" to know the dragon's name.
We find that the kobold's name is Has-Many-Fingers, and he promptly gets nicknamed as [[Haz]].
Haz tells us there are "many kobolds. one of guards talked of scary people. [[Wears-Many-Scales]] may have a dragon shield. Is guarding Speaks-With-Drakes."
Speaks-With-Drakes is magical somehow, and can talk to dragons. Wears-Many-Scales is guarding them.

The party levels up to lvl 2. Jenga now has farther range of darkvision and so takes front as the party proceeds. Vopina loses her hair in a wild magic incident.
