The party keeps travelling. 
Bureizu gives Sarya a talk of basically "you hurt them, I hurt you." He also tells the party that Zil is a dragon but wasn't aware that no one else had noticed. He reveals that he comes from a land ruled by a dragon.

The party hears lightning in the distance. They come across a behir and hiding from it does not work. Bureizu gets the final hit on it thanks to his echo, Bureitwo, and the party takes scales from it. 
Jenga gets Larry to Enlarge her so she can give Haz an even bigger hug. Bureizu says something about stockholm syndrome and Haz flips him off. Sarya asks Haz' opinion of Jenga. He says "Jenga nice lady, she give me food and shiny!" He also looks angrily at Sarya and flips her off as well. She tries to pat his head and he bites her. There's brief talk about whether or not he has rabies and is generally overall clean.
Haz: "Me is cleaning self in river yesterday. Much going on purpose."
Buriezu: "He fell in the river."

The party finds some [[Wood Elven Ruins|ancient ruins]]. The door into them is magial, with no obvious way to open it. There are runes on the edges to open it when something is triggered. Elvish writing on the door reads `North Feywood Armory` and below that it reads `those who share our blood may enter`.
Sarya puts a hand on the door and nothing happens, and Jenga realizes that it needs wood elven blood. She touches the door and it slides open upwards with a click. 

The walls are very smooth, except decorative details where they meet the floor and ceiling. Motives of flowering and geometrical shapes. Sconces on the wall light as the party passes. The party explores some office areas, one of which has a button that reads `DO NOT PRESS dumbass`. Larry finds a paperweight with runes on it and a gap where a name should be. `Administrator ___`.
There are several documents, some of them letters. An unsent letter shows the last admin to have worked there complained to a higher up as to the purpose of them being there when there was no one to be an admin for except for a different admin. A second unsent letter again complains about having a seperate admin, and mentions that they weren't expecting a bunch of researchers and are more qualified than this. The third letter requests a promotion, citing a lack of a need to be there, and the fourth lett insults their superior's mother.

There are also some experiment logs, all dated after the unsent letter. Most of them involve striking various materials with mithril weaponry. The results are unremarkable and more testimony from subjects amount to 'light, easy to swing,' Out of place, however, is the document titled `Project Lodestone`.
It reads:
`Canceled after current subjects [illegible] broke. Subject contained at [redacted]`.
A note on the bottom says that after this incident, the admin was deemed unqualified for this capacity.

There are blank documents, formatted for information like name, age, type of blood, and rank.

When Jenga picks up a keycard, it says in Elvish, 'what is your name?' She puts it down and it says 'resetting.' Sarya tries but gives her name as "Sarya Ralorora."
The card chimes, 'greets, administrator Sarya Ralorora.'
She now has card to help access more rooms. The party goes on to find some bedrooms with some magical beads, and then find bathrooms with temperature controlled baths, essentially, hot tubs. The party enjoys the break, splashing about in the water. Sarya playfully flirts with Gymmy and Bureizu, who teleports out upset. He explains that the last time an elf flirted with him, he almost got stabbed.
Gimbal refuses to enter the water with the rest of us and stays outside. 

After that, the party loots a storage area. Shava gets a mithril rapier. Jenga finds a keycard that now recognizes her as 'Overseer Jenga Squallsong.' She finds a raised panel and opens it to reveal hidden rooms.

There are 8 symbols over 8 doors.
- A dragon head
- A butterfly
- An abjuration symbol
- A doorframe symbol
- A mask (drama style)
- Crossed bones
- A panflute
- Crossed bars icon (which fascinates Larry)

The dragon head room has 6 stone busts of dragon heads. four are large, two are small and branch from the same neck. They have empty eye sockets and open mouth, where the small heads each have one eye open. There are some trays. The first has five crystal beads. Obsidian, quartz, ruby, emerald, and sapphire. The second tray has five metal beads. Copper, bronze, brass, silver, and gold. The third tray has 2 bottles of alchemy fire, a vial of acid, a bottle of lightning, a bottle with some water, and a bottle of something unidentified. 

Head one: Ruby in left eye, fire in mouth, gold.
Head two: Bronze, sapphire, lightning.
Head three: Copper, obsidian, acid.
Head four: Quartz, silver, water freezed with ray of frost.
Small head 1: Emerald, poison.
Small head 2: Brass, fire.

Upon completion of the puzzle, a pedestal emerges from the wall with a magical scythe, the blade of which detaches and floats. This is alloted to Gymmy.

The butterfly room has a mirror covering one wall. Across from it are 5 pedastles with objects. 
1. A gem studded vase
2. An elf skull
3. An arrow with an ornate glass head
4. A mundane leather bag
5. A lantern and a bottle of oil

The party tries swapping around the objects. They learn that the bag of a Bag of Devouring. 
Bureizu summons Bureitwo and we see that he has no reflection. Larry has heard of glass that can be a false mirror, replicating the room with illusions. Jenga shoots the mirror but her blast is reflected back onto her. Attacking the glass does not break it. Eventually Bureizu uses Bureitwo to teleport to the other side of it. There is an empty room. The illusions on the glass drop now and it is normal glass again. On the pedastle are mithril bracers.

The party enters the warding symboled door next. The puzzle is a set of red buttons to be stood on by various people to open certain doors at certain times. Upon making it through, Finnwell recieves a cloth mantle to be worn over the shoulders, and it seems to be enchanted. 

The party takes on the mask icon room next. There is a humanoid creature on a chair, a small girl with blue skin and elven features, wearing a sundress. She speaks to the party in their minds, and says, "greetings."
