Yri is invited to join the Amber Guard. He will still live at the estate, obviously. Drusilla goes to interrogate an assassin that Sarya had captured.

The finds a bill on their door. The reward for helping went towards covering repairs in the floor. Larry uses Create Food and Water and Flies flavors it with Prestidigitation, though he makes it all spicy. 

Jenga goes carousing and get more contacts. She meets [[Baron Wilfred]], the baron of Maplewood. 
There's [[Rutgar]], a goliath who is a member of the Adamant Guard.
[[Eliza]] is a noblewoman on the list of waiting.

Gymmy runs into some issues at a temple when he spills ink on an important document and goes to find Finnwell to magically clean it, leading temple officials to suspect him of stealing it. This blows over easy enough, however.

The 55th of Springtide, the party eats breakfast and hires a cleaning woman for the house, [[Margret Hatchward]], for the cost of 6 gold a month.

Caelynn stops by to inform Jenga there's been a small complication upgrading the Rod of the Pact keeper. Basically the part of it connecting Jenga to her patron is really old and wonky. The rod can be used as either a +1 or a +2 rod but that runs the chance of something bad happening. 

The party goes to the Silver Key headquarters and are introduced to the man who they had handed Lia off to. He introduces himself as [[Heian]].

There is another person here, a man around 6 feet tall in thick black robes. He has a skull mask with glowing green eyes and a dark black hat. Heian says he's hired help for the operation. His named is [[Morrowzeer]]. 

The group is going to move out the next day, with the VIP Lia in a boxed wagon warded from teleportation and extraplanar travel. They will be heading out [[Masonport]], a capital city in the County of [[Cliffshire]]. There's a small discussion then about how the Duchess is closely related to the current ruling family, while the Count of Cliffshire is not. 
It's a week to get to Cliffshire. The plan is that from there they will get on a boat overseas to the old capital of the Silver Dragon City, in the western have of Pelagius.

Bureizu explains the odd events of the tournament. They are concerned that the Lolthites will be investigating them.
The party learns that the lolthites employ demons, and they also learn that the previous head of the guard was corrupt, and dealt with lolthites.

The next day, someone knocks on the door. It's [[Margret Hatchward]], the hired housekeeper for the Ironheart Estate. She's a older human woman with silver hair. Shortly after she arrives comes Sarya and Zawisza, who says they are heading north for a bit but will meet back up with the rest of the party. A final knock on the door is an unfamiliar figure who tosses a letter and runs off. The letter is blank, and it's likely that the figure was Heian, and the paper simply a reminder to meet that night.

The party heads out. It's the 56th of Springtide. They meet the Silver Key at the eastern gate and head off.
