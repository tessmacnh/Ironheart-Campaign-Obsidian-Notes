The party proceeds around the island shore. Gymmy reuinites with them (he hadn't been present last session). They kill a bone hydra and take a long rest, during which they level up to level 13. 

The party reaches the hill that the cult is within. Jenga, overly eager, goes into the ethereal plane and glides into the mountain. She sees recently lit torches, and a utilitarian dining area. Through some more doors she finds a large room. Cultists are centered around someone by an altar that has a person restrained on it. A cultist tiefling woman in a similar dress to those like the cultists in the santum says something and raises an ornamental dagger. She plunges it into the woman's chest. The dagger glows faintly.
Jenga is about to leave then when a cultist somehow sees her and points to her. Her etherealness is dispelled and she falls. Cultists quickly surround her. The cultist who killed the woman speaks.
"Intruders sent by the false eternals, I presume."
Jenga: "False what?"
Cultist: "Fucking snake people. You have intruded upon the sanctum. Resist not, or your fate will be worse."
Jenga tries to Dimension Door away, but gets counterspelled. A bag is put over her head and she goes unconscious.

The party infiltrates the cult through an enterance they find and discovers Jenga 100 feet above a platform surrounded by a channel of liquid flesh. She ends up falling and waking up. The party fights some bone nagas and retreat from the fight, nearly losing Yri.
