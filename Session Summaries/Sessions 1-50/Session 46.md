The Lady Ferrum is in the harbor. Some sailors of the crew, [[Nix]] and [[Pecker]], say that Thiala is getting antsy. The party tells Thiala that they lost someone and she's not very happy.

The next day, the party returns to the Maiden of the East restaurant. They meet Lorcan again.
Lorcan: "Welcome back. I believe now is time for you all to read over and sign the documents fortifying the agreements we've made. I will hand you each your documents individually. If you have complains, voice them with me in private, we will made alterations as necessary. Otherwise, there's no need to pull anyone aside."
He pulls some parchments from thin air and writes basically at the speed of copy+paste. 

The party gives the [[Dagger of the Envoy]] to Gimbal so he can read. Lorcan mentions that Gimbal needs to use him 'true name' on the contract. The party out of respect for Gimbal all turn away when he momentarily needs to remove his mask and hood.

The party returns to the ship once business is done. Gimbal expresses his wishes to go back to his family. The party gives him money to take. Before leaving, he removes his hood and mask and reveals himself to be a goblin. His true name is [[Gimbal|Gabbro]].

Jenga sells her cat eye gems looted from the mines, and sends her money and her Rod of the Pact Keeper to Caelynn in the mail for repairs. 

The next stop on the trip is 3 days away, at the territory of [[House Aquila]].
Jenga holds a meeting and informs the crew of what happened in the mines and why Bureizu isn't with them.

The party fights some harpies. Clarity holds daily optional meetings, like a 15 minute discussion on proper sleep schedules. 

Jenga and Sarya spill their sob stories to each other. Jenga tells Sarya about her time in a cult, and Sarya tells Jenga about her wife who supposedly committed suicide because of her.
