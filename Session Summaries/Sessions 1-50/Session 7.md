Still 18th of Springtide

Jenga takes watch and sees a figure in armor approaching. He claims to be there to help the party. Gimbal asks him some questions. This is [[Finnwell]], a fighter with blue hair and a yellow scarf. 

As the newly expanded party proceeds down the sewers, a suspicious rat follows them. Later, they overhear a conversation, and Gimbal scouts ahead. He reports 2 rats having a conversation in common. They are scared of someone with magic and are planning something.

We engage in combat with wererats. Finnwell gets bitten but not infected. He later gives hand crossbows and bolts to Haz, who now likes him.

The party splits. Jenga goes with Haz, Gymmy, and Finnwell. Bureizu and Larry go elsewhere.

The group of 4 find shelved walls with jars of ash. Jenga has heard of burying dead in jars with their valuables and opens a jar. There is something shiny inside. She takes out a gold ring but the disturbed ash forms 4 shapes in the air.

The group fights ash wraiths. Some continue to form, and start choking Haz and Jenga. Gymmy bitch-slaps the final one to death.

We learn that in Brazenfell it is taboo to cremate the dead, it's supposedly painful for the deceased and is only done in case of death by disease. These jars were likely made to save space, and the people not given proper rites.
