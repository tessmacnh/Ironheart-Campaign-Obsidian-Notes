It is currently the 7th of Springtide.

The party faces an ambush drake. Apparently rescued a guy named Philip who promises to reutrn the favor (I was notetaker wasn't there so I don't have the details.) A secret compartment in the mine leads to an area with a large bug in it, a carrion crawler. It nearly carries Gymmy away before Larry killed it with a ray of frost in its mouth.

The party searches the room for loot. Jenga finds a Luckstone. The party finds coin.

More kobolds are fought as the party crosses a bridge.
We overhear a conversation.

(Anything marked with a `?` is because I as notetaker am unsure what was said)
Voice 1, unaccented common but still kobold: "Idiots, I can singelhandedly deal with this disturbance but you insist on keeping me here (in leash?) and this godforsaken curse."
Voice 2: "You think me is stupid? Me is knowing what you want, me not about to let you win. Me is not happy about you speaking of blessing as curse. Me is well aware what happen when me let go of leash. Wear-Many-Scales. You are armored, that is your name." There is hesitation.
Voice 1, WMS: "You're all beneath me. You're lucky I'm restrained or I'd deal with you all. I offered to take out the invaders not because of sympathy for you, but I don't want to be forced to return to... Well, you know."
Voice 2: "You would do well to hold your tongue. Our lord would smite you verily if he heard you speak such blasphemy. if you so sure you deal with invader, you stay here and deal if invader come here."
WMS: "So you insist on letting me stay here while your underlings get slaughtered. What was the point of binding me if only to keep me as a trophy? I'll be in this corner if you need me."
There is the sound of an armored figure sharpening a weapon.

The party enters the hallway and fights Wears-Many-Scales. There is also a brilliantly red kobold in the chamber, presumed to be Speaks-With-Drakes. They are certainly magical, as they compel Gimbal to move closer. The party tries to snap him out of it but Gimbal is convinced that everyone but him is being mind controlled. He does finally snap out of it with help from Larry.

The fight ends. Searching SWD results in some armor and a pendant, a long sword, and coin.

Over a short rest, Jenga examines in the scale mail armor. On each scale is a word saying `Sybil` in tiny letters.

The amulet has a plate on it that when pressed reveals a full name, [[Sybil Eisner]]. Below it is written `Lieutenant`.
Vopina says her parents have discussed the name Eisner, he's apparently some "big-shot general for Brazenfell."

The party unites with the retainers and Haz outside the mines. Haz isn't too sad to hear that the 2 kobolds we fought are dead, but does say that SWD told WMS that if she failed her duty, she would have the end herself. Jenga gives him the scale-mail armor and he is ecstatic.
