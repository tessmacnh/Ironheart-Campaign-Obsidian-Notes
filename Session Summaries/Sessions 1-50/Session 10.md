Shava has ragged breathing, and a fever.

The party crosses the sewer with her and proceeds. They encounter a mechanical mimic that nearly kills Shava. The party finds a strange [[Draconic Poem]] that seems to describe all of them, as well as others who have not joined them yet. It gave them the benefits of a long rest. 

The party, in the next chamber, fights a Drider. It's maniacal laughter barely stops throughout the fight.
Haz crits with his sling and knocks it from the ceiling into the sewage below.
It becomes very wounded. "Death is preferable to failure, I will serve the lady-" *coughing*.

Gymmy frantically searches the body for something, sighs when he finds whatever it is he is looking for.

The pendant is still glowing! The party finds a door with shallow breathing on the other side. We tell the person inside that we were sent by [[The Silver Key]].  The door opens to reveal a small figure in a raggy cloak, holding a dagger. It's a little drow girl who seems relieved to be leaving. Her name is [[Lia]]. She is clearly a child.

The party leaves the sewers. A man meets us. He basically tells Jenga 'good luck with that', referring to Shava. He takes Lia away and we meet another figure currently disguised as a half wood elf. She won't pay us in money but in magic items. Gymmy gets a laurel of wisdom, and Jenga is upset about not getting money, so she also gives us a pin from her ear, resembling a rapier coiled by silver roses, a [[Rosepin of Guises]]. It's given to Shava to disguise her.

On the way to [[Andri's]], the party finds guards tearing down wanted posters. There is a column of smoke rising from the Lord's Quarter.
"Why are you tearing down posters?"
"Duchess's orders. Don't quote me on this but apparently the captain of the guard put these up without her permission. Looks like he may be getting replaced soon which mean I may get a promotion! This all came up cause, well, you see the column of smoke. Apparently some dignitary from a vassal state got blown up."
"What was their name?"
"That's above my station, not my place to say."

Andri says that a courier came looking for us while we were away, and he may be back.

Jenga wakes on the 19th of Springtide with Andri in her room, who cleaned Shava's infections and gave her something to help with her fever. Jenga loosely explained what happened. Andri warns her, "it's easy to say it'll all be fine until it's not."
Shava's fever is now gone.

After breakfast, a human man in his 30's is waiting for us.
"Would you be the travelling companions of [[Vopina Crimsonleaf]]? I'd like you to come with me."
We do so.
"The duchess wants to see you concerning yesterday's events."
It is a 15 minute walk. We are waved in. We go the the [[Gilderlook]], which is the seat of the duchess. 
We finally all meet [[Duchess Eloise Amberleaf]], a woman in her middle ages, with brown/orange hair and a strange sadness about her.

"Welcome. You would be the travelling companions of Vopina Crimsonleaf?"
"Yeah."
"I must speak to you about her #assassination."
