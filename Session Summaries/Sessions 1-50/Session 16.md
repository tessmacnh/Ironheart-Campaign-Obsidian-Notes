The ground shakes as roots pull themselves up, but everyone keeps their footing.
the fight starts. Jenga is hyped to use Fireball for the first time. The party quickly learns that the buds can emit a spore-like powder that smells horrible and can temporarily incapacitate you. The fight goes on, and finally, Yri dies to an attack from the corpse flower. Distressed at her ally falling, Jenga blasts the corpse flower in nothing but plant matter and rotting remains.

The moment it is dead, Gymmy moves into action. He knows that a flower like this can result from a necromancer being buried, and there may be something where the corpse flower once sat. Finnwell helps him open up the flower. Inside is an intact runed cloak, and a corpse, with a satchel intact on its side. The satchel contains a dozen diamonds.

Gymmy resurrects Yri with one of the diamonds. He asks Yri what he saw when he died. Yri just mentions seeing a city of some sort. 

The party finally takes a long rest. The corpse of the necromancer is that of a male elf and matches the spectral figure seen earlier by Gymmy. Yri helps Shava harvest parts of the flower for use in health potions. The party enjoys a well-earned drink and Yri gets shit-faced. Some of them get paranoid about something in the trees until Jenga sees that it's only a deer. Jenga teaches Shava how to do 'cheers' with a drink. Haz falls on his face. 

The party returns to the cart and keeps heading north. 
It is the 32nd of Springtide as the party approaches a badly damaged swathe of forest ahead. It seems like there were some big monsters fighting each other. The party hears nearly a dozen roaring voices in the distance.

The party determines that despite all the noise, there are only two beasts. Gimbal puts an illusion over the wagon. A hydra charges across the clearing, pursued by another one. The party carefully moves forward but eventually, the remaining hydra spots them. 

A chase happens. The party focuses on hampering the hydra. As they hold it off behind them, Larry preps the [[Alchemy Jug]] with mayonaisse. When the jug is finally full, Finnwell uses Prestidigitation to flavor the mayo like meat. Jenga pours the mayo out of the back of the cart but accidently drops the jug in the process, losing it. However, the distraction works, and the hydra stops to eat the mayo.
