The party takes a short rest.
Jenga returns the weapons she had been given.
The party shares some drinks. Jenga checks in with Shava since she was also possessed. Shava says she'll be okay. 
Sarya has a talk with Yri about wanted to resolve tensions, particularly between him and Jenga.

The party finds the loot room, and become very very wealthy with the many 500g gemstones they find. (11 total).

The party goes to leave. Jenga shoots the guarding statue through the bars of the portcullis but it doesn't seem to be animated in any way. When she shoots the gargoyles, however, they spring to life and the party fights. 
After the fight, Haz has fun with the 'Fly' spell on him and pretends to be a dragon. Gimbal does a double backflip across the river but is one-upped by Finnwell, who does a triple backflip. The party returns to the cart where Zil is waiting, and they inform him that they are done. 
"Tell the duchess Verzilverd is more than willing to aid her as a possible patron of whatever settlement ends up here. Additionally, I figure that seeing as you had to deal with the old owner, on top of payment, I owe you a favor. So, take this." He gives Sarya a [[Dragon-touched Bell|small silver bell]].
"Shake it with a vigor if you need me, I'll be sure to stop by if you're in the area."
He pays Sarya some platinum, since he hired her originally. He then appears to fly over the wall of the keep. At this point, Bureizu is the only one to have realized that Zil is a silver dragon.

It's therapy time! Sarya taps Jenga and brings her and Yri over, and waves everyone around. She says she will consider joining the party if Jenga and Yri can work things out. She uses both Zone of Truth and a charm to make sure they answer questions honestly and entirely. 
Yri's main issue with Jenga is that she didn't hesitate to kill a defenseless goblin, left a man to die in a medbay, and is in addition both impulsive and irresponsible. These issues an be resolved if she is willing to claim repsonsibility. Jenga's issue with Yri is she feels like he is overly hostile and always waiting to call her out for the slightest fault. 

Sarya pries into Jenga's relationship with Shava and learns that Shava considers herself to be Jenga's servant. Shava weighs in on this as well.
"The original idea was as my superior in the order of the world, I am subservient, and in exchange for preventing me of dying of delerium and fever in the sewers, I would be in their service. It was something I did willingly. Perhaps not in the clearest mind, but it is not something that, independently, I regret."

Sarya asks Jenga if she regrets what she has done. Jenga does regret leaving a man to die, but not killing the goblin.
"He would do horrible things if we let him go. He was doing them before, he would have kept doing it."
Sarya tells Yri the killing of the goblin was a justified action. She does say that Jenga should apologize, but Jenga argues against Sarya's reasoning that her actions affected the party's reputation, as she doesn't think the party has much of one. 

Sarya eventually says that she can give Jenga advice and look over her actions. Jenga, a bit pissed at the idea, rejects it, but has no other ideas. Sarya says to just give more to the party and apologize. Jenga still dodges around doing so but accepts Sarya's offer of advice, saying "but I reserve the right to tell you to back the fuck off."
"Sure, but I'm not repsponsible for you then."
Yri apologizes for the drop kicking incident. Sarya declares that they may not be friends, but they don't need to be enemies anymore. Jenga is thrilled to consider Sarya a friend.
