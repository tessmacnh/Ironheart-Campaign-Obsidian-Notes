The party leaves the mines and takes a long rest before re-entering.

They fight nightmare-mounted cambions. They head downriver during further exploration of the mines and later overhear a conversation past a door. In Abyssal, demons are discussing how a valuable gem could be used to 'go home.'

The party fights a 4 armed demon, nearly dying but pulling through. Jenga sees a rock on the wall, unmistakingly the one she has been told to get. She grabs it, but a portal to Hell opens up in its place.
