On the 5th of summer, there is a cape in the distance. The party has reached [[Brazenhold]]

The party sends a letter to the Soldaten embassy they accidently ignored, and Jenga writes a letter to Caelyn about their travels. They go to the [[Courier's Office]] to send them off. There is a letter addressed to them from the Gilderlook, with a formal seal, and one addressed to Jenga.

The Gilderlook letter sends a replacement [[Enchanted Handkerchief|handkerchief]] for Larry to make up for the one he lost in the armory. The party wonders how they knew he lost it and resolve to look at the enchantments later.

Jenga's letter is from Caelynn. It says that to do repairs on the rod she will need the rod and 5,000 gold. The party agrees to raise money for it by selling loot from the pirate ship.

Jenga: "Gimbal, are you a child?"
Gimbal: "Do I have to answer that?"
Jenga: "...Haha, no, I don't care. Let's go get drunk."

The party encounters Zawisza in a tavern. She agrees to tell Sarya that we are looking for her if they cross paths.

Larry identifies that the enchant handkerchiefs are used as tracking devices. Thiala doesn't think it's much of a concern. The duchess responded to a question sent via Sending spell that it's so they don't get lost, and also to locate them if they are taken captive.

The party encounters sahuagin, shark creatures in the water. They fight.

Jenga has a dream that night from her patron, telling her of some nearby mines she has business to do with.

Jenga gets drinks with Shava the next day. The party plays with the fortune telling ball that Gymmy got ([[The Sphere of Future Knowledge]]). It says Jenga and Shava will end up romantically together. It also says that Jenga's mom is alive, but Jenga will not find her, at which point Jenga disregards anything it says.

A half-drow crewmate, Oni, makes moves on Jenga. She gets egged on into kissing him, which is technically her first kiss, but Shava then gives her a kiss afterwards and Jenga freaks out in gay panic.

Jenga tells the party that there is a job in some nearby mines they could go on to grab some cash. The party goes to get the papers for the job and arrive just as the warrant is being posted.
