Gimbal eventually rejoins the party. Thiala gives the party a portion of their payment, in the form of a magic hand crossbow. 

The ship the party will be taking is the [[Lady Ferrum|Rowdy Cowbird]], it's docked on the south side of the mason canyon opening. The party had to go make sure it's all set by meeting with someone on board.

Jenga and Haz get drunk off [[Otterale]] and eat satled pretzels. Gymmy goes to the docks to meet a dwarf who says that the captain of the ship, [[Captain Greymist]], is in poor health, so he's taken command. 

At the end of the day, the party all head to the docks and get a tour of the ship. The crew gives them a wide berth and strangely, none of them speak when they are nearby. Jenga casts message on one of them.
J: "Hey, I mean well, but things here don't look right. Are you alright?"
The man recoils and hesitates, but responds.
Man: "We're captives. Underground elves stole into my village. None of us know where we are. We were told to avoid you."

Back in the tavern, Jenga tells the party what she discovered. They know there are at least a dozen on board the ship. Yri decided to get the local guards involved and they will make an ambush in the morning.

After a long rest, Yri goes to [[Stonecrest Keep]] and alerts the authorities. The captain of the guard, [[Johann Everfast]], will lend two-dozen guards to form a perimeter around the docks. 

The party goes to the Rowdy Cowbird with a cart, one that isn't Thiala's. They get the cart on before starting combat, catching the dwarf off guard.

During the fight, Jenga runs down the stairs. She yells that if the captives want to revolt, and get out of there, now is the time to leave. 
The dwarf reveals himself to be a tall, well-dressed drow armed with poisoned blades. A deck mage summons a yochlol to charm Buriezu. On the lower deck, Jenga sees a warrior kill one of the slaves (who had been out-of-character referred to as 'Buddy') she was fighting alongside, as well as several others. Jenga accidently sets some crates on fire and starts yelling for help.
Bureizu kills the yochlol and Gymmy gets to the lower deck to revive some of the fallen slaves. The human decides to keep going by Buddy instead of his former name. 

The party loots the place and finds a [[Belt of Storm Giant Strength]] that goes to Bureizu, making him incredibly strong. 

Jenga discovered the former crew of the ship drowned at the bottom of the harbor. Johann says the party can keep the ship for themselves, and Thiala suggests they learn how to sail.
