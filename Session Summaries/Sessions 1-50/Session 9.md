Past the room of cubes, there is a dirty room with some traps Gimbal disarms. As the group proceeds, Bureizu's pendant glows faintly. He paces the hallway. The party sees a handle on a door jiggling, but no one responses to their questions.

A cloaked figure across the sewer hall waves to the party. Jenga realizes their darkvision is equal to her own, so they must be a drow. The figure doesn't respond to her questions and then the party is attacked. Magical darkness complicates the fight. Larry and Gimbal pursue a fleeing drow. 
Jenga shoots fire at a drow, burning off her robes to reveal red and black armor beneath. Jenga winks at her, surprising her so much that Bureizu gets advantage on his next attack. He thinks about killing her, but knocks her out with the pommel of his sword.

The fleeing drow picks up Gimbal, and yells in elvish, "back up or the little one gets it!" Jenga translates for the rest of the party.
Finnwell takes a risky shot, attacking with his axe, and manages to hit and kill the drow, saving Gimbal's life. 

The fight done, we tie up the captured drow to interrogate her. Bureizu slaps her awake and Jenga goes "hiii~"
Bureizu: "Are you *flirting with her?* She tries to kill us!"
Jenga: "We don't know why she tried to kill us!"
As Jenga is the only one who can speak to the drow in Elvish, she gets to translate.

J: "Hi, my name's Jenga, what's your name?"
Drow: "None of your business. You yourself do not seem to be (mark??) (?) what is your acquaintance doing wearing the symbol of the dancing bastard?"
Bureizu: "Tell her to mind her own business."
He says some slurs, Jenga tries to slap him but does translate for the elf.
Drow: "It is my business."
J: "What are you doing in these sewers?"
Drow: "The dancing bastards stole the incumbent priestess with intent to reclaim her to bring her back to (?)"
J: "Who's the high priestess?"
Drow: "The high priestess of Lolth."
We realize that the person who are tracking is next in line to be this high priestess.
Jenga asks if there is a reward for helping, the drow says they could maybe get extra.
J: "We ran into a follower of [[Eilistraee]], was she trying to deceive us?"
Drow: "Followers of the dancing bastard are not to be trusted."
J: "Can you tell me about Lolth?"
Drow: "Our fair lady of silk and string. She is the true ruler of the Underdark and the planes, for now, though, she is a guardian of our people. Our people are selected to be her priests."
J: "Why was this person stolen?"
Drow: "Because the dancing bastards are bastards who hate us!"
We thought the person we are looking for was on the run, not that she was kidnapped.
J: "Any chance she ran away, not stolen?"
Drow: "The dancing bastards are skilled in enchantment. The first thing they steal is the mind. Can't have a straight conversation without realizing ten minutes later that you were charmed by them, and then you tell them everything they want to know. That's why we shoot first."
Bureizu, to Jenga: "If they enchanted her, they would have her, but we are looking for her. Do you really thing this is unbiased?"
J: "I think both sides have a bias."
B: "I prefer not to make a deal on a job we've started."
J to Drow: "My friend here doesn't want to help you."
Drow: "How much money were you offered?"
J: "2000."
Drow: We can easily exceed that."
J: "By how much?"
Drow: "By thousands, do you want a number?"
J: "Yes."
Drow: "10,000."
Bureizu: "As tempting as that is, what I said stands true."
J: "Bureizu things you're lying."
Drow: "I understand the skepticism but you do realize this whole dealing was with an enchantress?"
Small party debate.
J: "As lovely as you are, my party seems to be against the idea of aiding you. I'm going to do my best to persuade them to at least, you know, not harm you further, but I'm really sorry, I don't think we'll be able to help you- It is *very* tempting though." 
Jenga winks, the drow blushes.
J: "But if you ever need help my name is Jenga Squallsong, if you need it, I'm always down to make money."
Drow mutters: "Well (??) not much else to discuss."
J: "Actually there is, where are the other drow in these sewers?"
Drow: "We have other teams searching, certianly, I'm not aware of any certain locations. I will say we've searched the whole sewer west of here- I don't know why I said that, I shouldn't have told you."
Jenga smiles. "Well I very much appreciate the information."
Drow: "I have one last request. I don't care if I remain a prisoner but don't leave me here."
J: "Where would you like to be left?"
Drow: "A failure with a task like this is worthy of execution. Let's just say most of the people around these parts are not my friend."
J: "I could be your friend."
The drow starts crying.
Drow "I'll work for my own food and shelter."
Bureizu wants her to promise not to go back to the underdark, she agrees.
J: "Please be careful around him, I wouldn't want anything to happen to your pretty face. Can we have your name, or something we can call you?"
Drow: "My name... Name, name... I don't get asked that very often."
J: "That's a shame."
Drow: "How so?"
J: "I think anyone looking at you would find you so intriuing they'd just have to know your name."
Drow: "I suppose it would be [[Shava]], that is my house's name."

The party takes a short rest.

Note: Unsure at what time but at some point in the sewers, the party heard a distant explosion from the surface.
