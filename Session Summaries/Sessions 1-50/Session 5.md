It is the 17th of Springtide.

The party is approaching [[Amberstead]]. We enter from the south gate, the largest of 3 gates. 
We go to the mage tower to try and sell the ambush drake. Jenga gets a nat 20 on persuasion and it is sold for 600 gold. 
We are informed that the arcane college has a travelling fair coming up in four weeks time, on the 45th.

Jenga asks the mage woman about the amulet she found in the mines. It's a pendant of the [[Adamant Guard]], a military from further north. Sort of like a membership badge for soldiers. 

There are more wanted posters in the street, like the one in the tavern in [[Maplewood]]. 
`Wanted: Female dark elf wandering through the city. Wanted alive. 1000 gold bounty.`
The portrait is more or less the bare features of a dark elf.

Jenga goes looking for a bakery in the southwest part of town that she remembers visiting yearly with her dad. It's undergone a change of managment and has a new name, [[The Fireheart Bakery]], run by [[Bree]].

Gimbal mentions how "Mom says I shouldn't have sweets" but Jenga talks him into trying maple candy, and he loves it. Bureizu looks for anything with orange or tropical flavor that reminds him of where he is from, but finds nothing of the sort. Haz pays a gold piece for a bag of 100 maple candies.

Jenga goes to the library of [[Campus Historia]] of the bard's college in Amberstead, which has both that campus and [[Campus Arcana]]. She meets a half high elf running the front desk. Haz waits in the lobby for Jenga to finished the business she has inside.

Inside the library, Jenga does a job she was asked to do by her [[Lorcan|patron]], and in the process, finds some information that could be about her unknown mother. She finds census data that lists an immigration that occured a few years before Jenga was born, of a wood elf coming to Maplewood from somewhere in the county of [[Firham]] to the north.

The party meets up in a potion shop run by a pixie. Gymmy mentions having dropped his money down a well, which confuses the party.

The party next goes to the [[Touch of Weave]] magic shop. Jenga enchants her comb, which was made by her father, and helps Haz buy an awakened shrub.
