The party is given a week until their mission starts. They are given gifts of [[Gilderspirit]], healing potions, and an [[Enchanted Handkerchief]], one per person.

Around the 22nd of Springtide, Larry meets the court wizard, an old halfling named [[Milo the Meticulous]]. He wants to make something called Dust of Dryness, which he can use to make arrows that release large amounts of water when they break.

Yri buys steel from the blacksmith in the main square. Meets a dwarf with red hair working at the forge.

Jenga buys lockpicks from [[Odds and Ends]], a store Gimbal shows her to. Gimbal and Jenga then work together to sell acid that Larry has made with his [[Alchemy Jug]], and they make 350 gold.

Jenga goes searching for contacts. She meets the half high elf woman from the library. Her name is [[Caelynn Liadon]]. She also meets a burly sailor man who gives him the name and address of his merchant ship, 'The Flight Wight', and a courier named [[Finnius]], who is around 20 years old, blond, and happy to lend her a favor if she needs it.

Gimbal spends the week working for [[The Fireheart Bakery]]. Finnwell does some research on the [[Brass Dragonlord]], who is associated with a continent of [[Calathor]] across the ocean to the east. He learns that the brass dragonlord is also associated with a shield called the [[Chalceum Speculum]].

Jenga buys a Wand of Smiles after using it to relentlessly annoy Bureizu.

Bureizu does some pit fighting, but isn't very popular after he breaks the nose of a favored fighter.
