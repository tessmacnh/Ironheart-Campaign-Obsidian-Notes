The party heads towards the mines. They eventually meet some paladins who call themselves the [[Order of the Watchers]]. The party finds many set up tents of paladins on vigil to deal with a explanar incursion. 

The party meets another person hired for the task, a half sea elf named [[Kari]].
The Order of the Watchers wants the party to identify an intercepted extraplanar presence on the border. In a prison tent is Sarya, and the party bails her out for 100 gold. 

The paladins, who are here with permission of [[House Berillo]], have evacuated the nearby town. 

In a tent, Jenga talks with Shava, who says the arrangement they have is still contractual. Jenga's bummed but accepts that. 

After a long rest, the party continues.

Outside the mines the party fights off some quasits. The first encounter inside the mines themselves involve some corpses lying around that Jenga tries to loot on Haz' behalf. The corpses come to life and surprise the party.

In the fight, Shava gets possessed by a demon. The demon runs away in her body. The party cannot follow her.
