The Ironhearts spend a peaceful first night in their new home. Sarya is cooking eggs for everyone when someone knocks on the door. It's Caelynn, who makes plans with Jenga to get some business done and also tells Jenga about the upcoming tournament. 

The party goes to pick up their outfits from the tailor. Jenga, Finnwell, and Haz go to Andri's to visit Andri, and Jenga thanks her for helping Shava. Sarya and Jenga go to sell things to the duchess and Sarya plays chess to try and barter the price. They decide to sell the coffin from the dragon lair to the Crimsonleaf family. They meet [[Lupian Crimsonleaf]], who buys the coffin from them for 7500 gold and also explains his intent to participate in the mage's tournament at the fair.

The party sells the rest of the goods. Bureizu makes eggs for dinner- Jenga had gone shopping earlier but only bought a ton of eggs and nothing else. Sarya and Jenga make attempt 2 at shopping but encounter wererats in the streets and run off because they don't feel like dealing with that.

The next day is the 45th of Springtide, and it's time for the fair! Stalls fill the streets and there are performances happening left and right!

Jenga meets up with Caelynn. Bureizu finds a small red psuedodragon that is looking for a human companion. It costs 30,000 gold but he rallies the party funds together to afford it. The psuedodragon, [[Flies-In-First]] aka Flies, is more than happy to be with Bureizu.

Sarya bumps into an eladrin elf named [[Zawisza]] who is here for the tournament. She's a college of blades bard.

Caelynn and Jenga break away from the group. They enter a stall being run by a halfling that sells various herbs, minerals, and it includes a chilled drawer of monster hearts. Jenga picks up a vaguely-humanoid looking one and is told that it is the heart of a succubi. She buys it for 450 (haggled down from 500). Leaing the cart, Haz reveals that he stole another jarred heart. Jenga gives both of them to Caelynn. 
She and Caelynn then stop by a stand selling vaguely labelled potions that didn't turn out as intended. Jenga tries one labelled `hot`, which Caelynn also took, and her whole body suddenly feels very dry. She tries one called `chill` and her mouth feels very minty. She exhales a cone of frost. Caelynn tries the same potion. When Jenga tries one labelled `phillus`, Caelynn does as well. Jenga realizes the 'hot' potion Caelynn drank was some sort of love potion. Jenga gets the potions `death` and `shock`, and then Caelynn buys one of each potion Jenga didn't get and gives them to her. Jenga tries to refuse but just takes them, figuring that once the potion wears off of Caelynn she will give them back.

Jenga goes to sign up for the mage's tournament, but under the influence of the potion, Caelynn does as well. It wears off shortly after and she is worried by this decision, as she cannot withdraw.

Caelynn leaves and Jenga spends some time with Shava.

On day 2 of the fair, Yri and Jenga enter the stall labelled 'Spacemakers' where bags of holding and portable holes are kept. Unfortunately, they have their own bag of holding with them. Upon stepping in the portable hole, both Jenga and Finnwell, who was standing nearby, are sucked into the Astral Plane.

They are floating in a void with distant stars of various sizes and colors. Holding onto each other to avoid drifting away, they decide to try and 'swim' to one of the closer stars. Upon getting closer it seems to be some sort of large, organic structure... They find themselves face to face with an Astral Dreadnaught, and are about to be caught in its grip when two figures pop in next to them, instruct them to hold on, and just as a massive crustacean claw strikes at Finnwell, the mages trace sigils of shimmering light, and they are all back on the material plane, on a rooftop.

Shava flies to the rooftop, and heals Finnwell. Jenga questions the mages. They are alumni of the arcane college who work at the fair to supervise. Finnwell and Jenga return to the group where they are pulled into hugs.

The group gets fried dough, next, and attend a circus! They claim to have a green dragon but it's clearly just a very old copper one.

Jenga and Shava are watching a light show when a tall eladrin elf sees Shava and says "Oh! I's been a long while since I've seen ya!" And gives her a bear hug. Shava doesn't really respond and Jenga questions how they know each other. The eladrin says "we used to work in the same branch. I've got to go, I have business to attent to before the duel, I hope I see you there!"
When she leaves, Shava is shocked, and then collapses and starts to hyperventilate. Jenga gives her some water and Shava says, "not an eladrin."
J: "What?"
S: "They're coming for me."
J: "Who?"
S: "Other drow. For safety, let's not discuss it here, let's pretend nothing's happened."
J: "Right. Right, we've had a wonderful night. Let's go back to the others."

After a firework show displayed the fight between [[Bahamut]] and [[Tiamat]], the party heads home, careful to be sure they aren't being followed.

Shava tells the party what happened. The drow disguised as an eladrin looked different than the one Sarya met, [[Zawisza]], but a lot like they were tyring to copy her features. Shava doesn't know why they could be after her. She isn't of religious signifigance. The next morning, for her safety, the party leaves her in the [[Gilderlook]], where the Duchess is more than happy to help them. 

Finally, it's time for the tournament! The matchups for round one are:
`Lupian - Falduim`
`Finnwell  Sorjun`
`Jarsali - Yri`
`Zawisza - Alexander`
`Zephryn - Jenga`
`Larry - Clarity`
`Sarya - Dewitt`
`Dilly - Caelynn`

Lupian wins agains Falduim, a large silver dragonborn.
Finnwel has a hard time against Sorjun, a dwarf who keeps raising his Armor of Agathys shield, and eventually loses.
Yri wins against Jarsali, an 8 foot tall firbolg
Zawisza wins gainst Alexandra, an evocation mage.
Jenga wins against Zephryn, an air genasi who can fly and turn invisible.
Larry loses to [[Clarity Duwell|Clarity]], an aasimar cleric.
Sarya loses to Barnabus.

At this point, Finnwell sees some cloaked figures in the stands. The party locates some guards.

Sarya loses to Dewitt, and poor Caelynn is instantly knocked out by Dilly, a halfling.

Finnwell, Bureizu, Sarya, and the other lost contestants go chase the hooded figures into the sewers but lose the trail. They aren't tall like drow, they seem to be much shorter. They ended up in front of a building with the windows boarded short, possibly a location of the Silver Key.

In the next few rounds, Jenga wins against Clarity, and moves on to the next round to fight Zawisza. Strangely enough, Zawisza has Jenga paralyzed to buy time to heal herself, but the spell somehow fails and Jenga is able to win. 

In the final round, it's Jenga vs Lupian, but to no surprise, the sorcerer wins, and Lupian gets the Staff of Power as his prize.
