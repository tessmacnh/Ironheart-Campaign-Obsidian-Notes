The party's new plan is to sail to the desert of Menagerie. The crew they pick is as follows:
Jenga: Captain
Flies: First mate
Bosun: Bureizu
Quartermaster: Gymmy
Surgeon: Shava
Cook: Finnwell

They all go for crash courses at the naval academy. 

The banner of Masonport is a lightning-wrapped trident crossed by a blade pin (sort of a pin used in sailor knots).

The party renames their vessel, the [[Lady Ferrum]]. They then spend 25 days training.

Jenga sells the pieces of the shrine she and Gymmy dismantled. Thiala sends a letter to Levius who will arrive in about a week.

A letter arrives for the Ironhearts. Bureizu recognizes the crest on it, a simple version of the crest of the [[Soldaten Empire]], an empire of hobgoblins and other goblinoids in the southern area of [[Pelagius]], in conflict with Shenjin.

*To the organization known as the Ironhearts,*
*We have witnessed your work, seen your handiwork on the docks of Masonport and have been impressed. We'd like to extend a formal invitation for you to visit the Soldaten embassy as guests of the head ambassador.*
*Specifically, we are interested in the unique magical and nonmagical artifice you have employed in dealing with what we are now aware of as slavers.*
*We would be interested in possible procurring your services, and we would be willing to discuss this further at your discretion.*
*Regards, [[Albrecht Botschafter]]*

The party decides to go to the embassy in a week.

They get sidetracked, however. Levius arrives on horseback that week, staying at the [[Hole in the Wall]].

The party hires the humans they freed to work as their crew aboard the Lady Ferrum. There's 14 of them, both men and woman, and some of them are half-drow.
Gymmy installs cannons on the ship.

They know the second branch of the journey will be heading through the [[Azure Sea]], with is along the southern area of the continent. 

That evening after training, Bureizu is ambushed in his room but someone who is covered in charcoal, perhaps as an attempt to look like a drow. They nearly steal his magic belt, but the party defeats them and gets it back. 

The party levels up to level 10.

The party finally departs Masonport on the 3rd of Summer! Jenga has her familiar take the form of a cat named Cap, and he hunts down bugs and mice on the ship.

A ship approached, flying the flag of Brazenfell. Jenga alerts the crew and soon after, the flag drops and is replaced with a black one. The crew and party work together to make the ship surrender, and the party boards and loots the ship.
