The sun is setting on the 34th of Springtide. Yri and Larry finish the gauntlet dagger project. The party arrives at the ruined fort ([[Silverkeep]]) and meet a figure who appears to be a human, with gray hair and pale gray eyes. He wears unusually light clothing for the region, a fancy leather vest and puffy loose pants. He ought to be cold but seems unbothered. He waves the party over.
"I thought I hired one of you! Seems to be a lot of you here."
The party is confused, saying they were hired by the duchess. The man is confused to hear that Amberstead has a duchess. He asks about a private investigator, and Sarya goes to speak with him. She asks if he is [[Verzilverd|Zil]], and he confirms that he is. 

Zil wants the party to scout out the fortress, which is crawling with traps and "mechanical nasties." He knew the last owner of the place but hasn't seen him in a while and is concerned. He says the party can take whatever they want from the castle as payment, so long as they leave anything of artistic value.

The group crosses the portcullis. Inside the gates there is a chapel, with shrines to Bahamut and other dragons. There is a mini monument to the [[Bronze Dragonlord]], Pyropus. Yri mentions that the bronze dragonlord marked his ancestors and thus him. 
The party fights bats in the chapel. After that, they attempt to enter the next gate but trigger a trap of scalding water. 

In the main hall, Jenga sees Haz holding a goblet.
"Haz, staying still will not prevent me from seeing you. Please put it down." He slowly does so.
Once Larry confirms that he can't see any magical signatures in the room, Jenga starts looting silverware from the table. In response, Yri attempts to drop kick her (for some reason??) and the aggression triggers magical suits of armor around the room, which had been concealed from detection.

The party is outnumbered but the suits don't seem designed to kill them, so Jenga and Yri allow themselves to be grappled. They are brought to a lower level. Shava scouts it out and reports seeing dead bodies in cells. 

As she is dragged along, Jenga sees a pale figure in the cell opposite the one Yri is put in.

Larry is also being taken, but the fight finished off the armor sets when only Yri and Jenga have been locked up. The ghost across from Jenga is rather racist and calls her knife-ears.

While the party fights, Jenga feels a horrible chill down her spine. The ghost in the cell next to her vanished, though she cannot see this. 
In the fight, Haz is killed by an Earth Myrmadon. Shava picks up the rather flattened remains of his body and runs for the stairs, screaming for a cleric. 
Sarya yells that they need to retreat. Jenga says "If I die, tell Shava and Haz I love them both very much!"
Sarya: "What does Haz look like?"
Jenga: "Orange kobold?"
Gimbal motions a hand over mouth to Sarya and she doesn't say anything more. 

Gymmy revives Haz, saying "Jenga would kill me if I let you die."
The party successfully makes it out, leaing Yri and Jenga in the cells, debately safe.

Jenga, in private, has a conversation with the ghost.

J: "Hi."
G: "Greetings."
J: "Any reason you're stopping by?"
G: "I was bored. Happens a lot. When you've got as much time as I do."
J: "I can't imagine it's fun down here."
G: "You can say that again."
J: "What happened to you, how'd you end up down here?"
G: "I was thrown down here, when I was visiting as an envoy from the north. I was assaulted by an escort who killed most of us, and threw me down here in a cell. One day these was a commotion, and then the plates kept coming but there was no food on them. It was a painful few weeks. Than I ended up like this."
J: "That's sad."
G: "I suppose I am away of my condition. My people work with the dead. Most others in these cells believe themselves to be living, stuck here for gods know how long."
Ghost in other cell: "Knife-ears, shut up, I'm trying to sleep!"
J: "Not pleasant, is he?"
G: "Been at least... Been far too fucking long to listen to that one rattle about my ears. But, tell me about yourself."
J: "My name's Jenga. I was raised by my human dad. Are you from Firham?"
G: "It was the closest human territory."
J: "What sorta elf are you, if I can ask?"
G: "Before I was like this? I was not unlike you."
J: "Wood elf, cool!"
G: "What's your name?"
J: "Jenga Squallsong."
G: "Those others, from before, I presume they are your friends?"
J: "For the most part. I hope so."
G: "Tell me about them."
Jenga tells the ghost about Gimbal, and Bureizu. The ghost interrupts.
G: "That blade he carries...?"
J: "The halberd?"
G: (nods) "It would not do well for my current form. When did you meet these friends?"
J: "At least a month ago, we've gone on adventures together."
G: "Do you have stories to tell?"
J: "Plenty, you wanna hear them?"

Jenga tells the ghost stories about her adventures both before and after meeting the party. The ghost is smiling, but her expression is hard to read. Seems like she misses this.
G: "I wish I could tell you about my old life, I remember little of it."
J: "Anything?"
G: "I was a diplomat. I was here to give a gift. The gift is not in this cell, it is in my cell, under the bed. It is a chain shirt, enchanted to be worn by even those with no expertise in such armor. I never reached the captain of this keep, so I suppose not much reached him. At some point- I have nothing but suspicion- but I suspect he is why food stopped coming, and the commotion happened."
J: "Gotcha. Well, is there anything my friends and I can do, to like, help you move on?"
G: "There is one thing. End him. He's still here, I know it, he sits at the top of his keep, certain of his perfect little fortress that never even saw battle, so sure it's impregnable. I want to see him ended in his own keep. I want to see it with my own eyes."
A chill goes over Jenga again but she resists it, and realizes that the ghost is trying to possess her.
J: "Hey, no possessions. We could bring you his head?"
G: "You misunderstand. How much do you know of your people?"
J: "Wood elves? Like, nothing."
G: "That is unfortunate. Death is not always the end, as I am proof of. The end will come when his end comes, and I want to see it."
She tries and fails again to possess Jenga.
G: "I want to end him. He made me starve, he will see his hubris toppled by my hand!"
The cold returns and the figure vanishes. Jenga hears, in her own voice speaking, the ghost once more.
G/J: "We will finish him. We will finish him. We will finish him. And then I will rest."

Jenga, in thoughts: *Can you let me talk? My friends are gonna be so confused.*
Ghost: "You understand not. I've been training for a moment like this since before I even past. It's something many of us knew how to do, though I dunno how much tradition kept. With all this time to sit and STARE- I will made sure that lord of this keep meets his end, and you will be the perfect tool."

The ghost, in Jenga's body, has a conversation with Yri, who does not notice anything different. He admits the whole thing is his fault, and shares an ale with 'Jenga'. Jenga watched the entire conversation, trapped in her own body, and asks the ghost another question in her mind.

J: *What are these traditions you speak of, that the wood elves did?*
G: 'Old magic. New magic. It is our craft, pushing the arcane to its limits beyond what others think is acceptable.'
J: *I knew people like that. You sound like my dad now. Bleh, that's weird.*
G: 'Your father seems like he would have liked your mother.'
J: *What do you know of my mother?*
G: 'If she's like the rest of us, I know all I need to.'
