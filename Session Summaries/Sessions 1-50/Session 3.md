The night of the 7th, the party settles down just within the mines to sleep. Jenga receives a vision from her [[Lorcan|warlock patron.]] 

The party is back in Maplewood by the 9th of Springtide. 

Jenga buys Haz a slingshot and ammo.

The party goes to the apothecary run by [[Amelia]], a half wood elf who knows Jenga, who is also from Maplewood. They exchange party loot for potions and also buy some with coin.

At the general store, Larry sells some maple sugar.

The party takes on the bear job they saw on the wanted poster back in [[Session 1]]. They investigate a farmhouse and the human man there tells them that a few nights ago, a big thing he thinks was a bear tore up some crops, destroyed a fence, and made off with a goat. 
The party follows very large bear tracks into the woods. Far in the forest, they spot feathers as well and realize that this is an owlbear that they are dealing with. The party enters stealth-mode. Jenga sets a bear trap at the top of a hill, covering it with an illusion. As the owlbear approached, the party retreats away a bit.
The bear trap does not work. Vopina finally kills it by burning the head from the body. 

Back at the tavern, the party is greeted with cheers at the sight of the owlbear head. 

The party levels up to level 3.
