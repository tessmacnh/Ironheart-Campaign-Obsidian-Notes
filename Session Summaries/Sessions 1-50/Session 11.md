We are shown to our rooms. Gymmy and Gimbal see that not all the guards are in the same uniform as the town guards, but are in fact more heavily armored. These wear the same pendant as the one Jenga recovered from the mines.

There is a guard escorting us. He is in chainmail armor with a gold and silver halberd on his back. He wears a red shirt over his chestpiece and a purple cape with gold lines on it. He stands at about 6'2". This is [[Yri]].
The uniformed guard members are part of the [[Adamant Guard]].

The guard takes us to a small room. Eventually a half high elf woman, older than us, enters and asks for Jenga. She brings Jenga to a small dim room with no windows, and they sit across each other in chairs. The woman asked if Jenga was aware of Vopina's inheritance and position in court, as well as if there was anyone who could have a grudge against her. Jenga denied anyone in the party having done anything illegal. 

One by one, everyone is interrogated. Bureizu never returns back to the room. Yri brings the party to the Duchess, who has requested an audience with them. In the meeting room we meet [[Moili]], a dwarven guard. 

The duchess tells us that Vopina was attacked in her chambers in the [[Gilderlook]] the previous evening. All that left was the remains of her and her 2 attackers, who may have been accomplices.

We get our own rooms and dinner is brought to them. The mead is good. Everyone meets in one room and Gimbal says that the duchess was hiding something. He's not sure Vopina is actually dead. 

Larry casts detect magic. A few floors above us are two small magical objects, both close to each other.

The party explores and finds a guarded room. They convince the guards to let them in, since they were close friends of Vopina. 

The inside of the room is blackened and charred. There are 3 sets of remains on the floor. It looks like an explosion went off. But there should be four bodies in the room, what happened to the retainers?

Jenga follows footprints in the ash to a burnt wardrobe, that has a false back leading to a secret passage. Meanwhile, Larry takes a look at the magical objects he detecte. The [[Ring of the Spy]] will kill the wearer when they become unconscious. It's used when politics get very cutthroat. 

The guard from before arrives, who we now know to be [[Yri]]. He is upset that the party has been touching things, but the party convinces him to help them check out the passageway, as Vopina may not be dead after all.

The party continues, minus Gymmy who is asleep in his room. There is a pair of burnt shoes in the passageway. Eventually they come to a wooden panel. Jenga opens it and stumbles into a room with 2 people in it: The duchess and Bureizu. 

"I suppose you've figured out the secret. Vopina survived the attack. Both attackers were killed instantly by wildmagic and so was one retainer. out of fear for her life and a bit of political maneuvering, I decided it would be best if everone thought she died. I sent her off with her retainers in a carriage to one of the off-shore states. In the meantime, I spent my time looking into who her attackers could be. None of you had any obvious connections nor reason to attack her. Most of you didn't know she was noble, not surprisingly. You're obviously not the attackers. We have high suspicions that it was some faction of aristocrats but that's besides the point. You all heard something you shouldn't. Seeing as I doubt you'd like to have your tongues cut off, I have a favor I'd like to ask."
The party does not, in fact, want their tongues removed.
"I am intending on sending an expedition up north to make new settlements. You will do there to reinstate several military positions. I am going to ask that you aid me. You will go with them and aid in setting up fortresses. The Count of Firham has always envied the riches of the [[Autumnwood]]. While I doubt he is responsible, this is an excuse to fortify my claim. This is not a request, but do you accept?"
The party does, none of them have much of a choice.
They will meet with the duchess again in the morning, and everyone spends the night in the [[Gilderlook]].
