Jenga checks the guards over. Word is spread of some rare pieces on display and a crowd forms of interested people. Sarya poses as the informant telling the crowd about the statues, occasionally picking them up to make sure none of them have been swapped for illusions. The presentation goes far and nightfall comes, when an alarm spell goes off and Sarya ends up caught in the forcecage triggered that was meant to catch the thief. The statue of illusion magic is gone.

Someone invisible passes Jenga, who's guarding a hall. She shoots them and uses Hurl Through Hell. Sarya escapes the forcecage and the party starts a chase/fight with a thief. The thief makes 3 copies of themself to confuse the party but in the end, Gymmy knocks them out. The statue is retrieved, along with some scarecrow-looking doll things resembling the guards that are humanoid size, a rope net covered in leaves, extra arrows, rations, some copper, and a bag of ball bearings.

The party speaks to Byron and gets their reward. The girls in the party then have a girl's night at [[The Lily Pad]], a restaurant in town. They enjoy fishsticks and other seafood on floating tables and see a sea cloak (manta ray) passing in the water.
Jenga talks some shit about Thiala, complaining about the time she didn't let the party sleep much, but it turns out Thiala is present at the table next to them. She tells the party that there are several reasons why she cannot use planar travel.
- There is no planar circle in their standard destination across the ocean in the Silver Dragonlord's Citadel.
- There is on in Menagerie, however.
- They don't have easy access to teleportation circles on the regular.
- When you have someone powerful as the high priestess of Lolth going after you, teleportation is dangerous. They can track it if it involves their ward (Lia).
- At worse, they can even intercept it.

The party briefly discusses how Gymmy is suspicious in various ways, and then Thiala hands them a paper.
"This was found by the crew on the upper deck."
It is a parchment paper sealed with wax. Looking at the text, it's as if it's projected in the mind.
`The Ironhearts,`
`Apologies for the trouble, but I've run into bit of a severe issue and noticed you were in town. I hate to ask this of you when I haven't done anything to deserve it, but I severely require your help. Bring force.`
`Signed, Zawisza.`
There is then a top-down drawing of Fortuna with a building circles.

Jenga sends Bottle over the check it. There is a warehouse with cloaked figures patrolling the exterior. They are armed. The party tries scrying on Zawisza to see if this is a trap, but the scrying is somehow blocked.

They go to the edge of the inner town, to the warehouse. Sarya sends in an Arcane Eye and sees eight hooded figures and a set of makeshift gallows in the back. There are three people with bags over their heads, and bound arms and legs, on it. One of them is Zawisza, the other two are in rags but are both drow. There are two drow in the back near the gallow levers, and the other six are scattered in the room. They are all waiting. 
The Arcane Eye is noticed. A drow pulls down their hood and says that they come in peace. One of the prisoners is familiar, and Jenga realizes that it is [[Shava]], she her necklace is glowing.

The Ironhearts enter.
"Greetings, Ironhearts," says a drow, "you've got something that we want. We have a couple things that you want."

The drow execute one of the prisoners, who seems to be [[Heian]]. Sarya tries to intimidate them. The bags are removed and the party can see Shava, missing an eye and an ear. Jenga cuts the ropes on the gallows and a fight starts.

It's revealed that Zawisza was not real and was in fact a simulacrum. The real one, apparently an enemy drow, has Shava at knifepoint. She threatens the party that there is a storm coming, seemingly referring to a third party of some sort, and they teleport away.

Leaving the warehouse, Ruey sets it on fire.

The party takes a long rest. They did successfully get Heian back, however, as his execution had been staged to scare them.
Jenga remains mad at Lunima, who was in favor of agreeing to the hostage exchange, because she feels that Shava being taken away was Lunima's fault.
