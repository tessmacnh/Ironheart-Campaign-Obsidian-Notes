Jenga hears Lorcan in her head that morning.
**"Do be sure to check your Books of Shadows."**
She finds on the first blank page a contract of sorts, though she can't read anything except for the two signing lines, one with Lorcan's signature and the other blank.
**"Good luck."**
*"Thanks."*
Jenga embarks on the job she has been given and goes to the guardhouse. She explains that she was involved in the capture of the thief and is let in. In a damp basement of cells, she finds the tabaxi handcuffed. She has stark black fur, golden eyes, and a white mask pattern of fur over her right eye. She looks at Jenga disapprovingly.
Jenga first approaches her like "hey, I also steal things sometimes, I'm pretty impressed," but that gets her nowhere. Finally, she says, "how would you like out?" She elaborates with "I can give you the power- and more- that you need to break out. Clearly you can't do so currently or you would have done so by now." She demonstrates her own powers by blasting a two foot hole in the stone wall. The tabaxi is impressed and Jenga explains some of her other powers. The tabaxi then asks how to get these powers.
Jenga: "I have a paper here you can sign. It will enter you into a pact with an individual I am associated with. His name is Lorcan, and he is able to provide these magics."
She gives the contract over to the tabaxi, who reads it over, then asks why Jenga is so interested in her signing it.
"I'm just trying to help you out, one thief to another."
She starts to sign, but realizes there is no ink. She pricks her finger on the quill, signs the contract, and the paper self-destructs. Then she stops, and tells Jenga, "could you stand over there and disappear for a moment?"
Jenga does so, and she yells, "guards? I need something."
A guard comes over. "Yes, thief?"
The tabaxi brings her cuffs close to the bars, mutters "unlock," and the guard unlocks her cuffs. As soon as she is free she draws a blade made of shadow and drives it into the guard who clutches the wound despite no mark being left. She leaves the cell and says, "I don't believe we exchanged names, have we?"
Jenga: "I don't think we have."
"I am [[Lucinda De'Anuli]]. This meeting has been a pleasure. Your name?"
"Jenga Squallsong."
"Squallsong... Noted." She drags the guard into the cell and takes some items. "I'm going to recover that which was confiscated from me, and I will go. This meeting was a pleasure but honestly, I hope we don't cross paths in the future."
Jenga: "No hard feelings."
Lucinda: "Farewell, good passing, and may the winds chase you well." She leaves, and Jenga teleports away. She is blocks away from the prison when the alarm is raised. She makes a stop to buy some things for Heian.

With one leg of the journey left to go, the group is nearly at Menagerie. 

Jenga can't find Sarya so she does first mate duties alongside her duties as captain. Sarya is off reading the [[Tome of Leadership and Influence]] (which Jenga had previously returned to her, stating it was too much effort to learn Celestial to read it.) Jenga also later finds a letter from Lunima with an apology on it and a bag of 87 maple candies, tied to her doorhandle.

Two weeks of sailing pass. A scuffle happens due to tension from Sarya being absent and she finally says she will be around the next day. Jenga asks Buddy about the tension.
Buddy: "Seems a bunch of my fellows have gotten it into their heads... Sarya wasn't always our first mate, but for the new folks, she's always been their first mate. It's almost as if the new crew is upset at the old crew for not being upset that Sarya isn't present. Also the old crew is taking piss on the new crew for being out of wack."

There are some shark people following the ship at a distance but they don't seem to be an issue. As the party passes swamps and rivers they see people on horseback trailing the ship from theland, probably just nomads. A week into the two weeks of sailing, the terrain is still marshy but it's getting drier. On day 9, the crew shouts and the rear sail is on fire, but it is put out. Jenga sees lights up ahead, possibly indicating a ghost ship. Not fond of ghosts, she takes extra time to pass around it.

They pass a mountain range, and the terrain near the shore is now dry and sandy. Finally, they reach [[Azurport]]!

Many people are here, some in silk, others in lots of clothing. It's the largest port the party has been to. There are creatures like horses but with humps, and guards that carry scimitars and bows. The party shops for clothing, and Haz steals some coin purses which he gives to Jenga, and she splits the money with him. They buy desert clothing from a loxodon named [[N'Didi]].

The group meets a man named [[Crazy Hassan]] who runs a tent selling literally any variety of camel. Literally any. The party gets some camels and a 'winter camel' that is just an alpaca. They also get camel insurance.
