Time passes. Aeri spends the week exploring. She's not used to so many plants all around. Lunima gets a license to ward the estate. Ruey starts a garden in the backyard and Sarya makes contacts (and gets acquainted with her body pillow of Bureizu.)
At the end of the work week, there is a knock on the door. It's [[Caelynn Liadon]], and she's looking for Jenga saying that she has something of hers. She gives Sarya a large wooden case to pass along to Jenga.
Sarya contacts Jenga via Sending Stone: "By the way, Caelynn dropped by a box."
Jenga: "Fuck yeah, awesome! By the way, remember letter from Soldaten embassy or something? Maybe follow through with that."
Sarya says to the group they could possibly do that as a group or she could do it if she ends up in the area.

Later that day, a message from the [[Gilderlook]] arrives.
`Ironhearts, you are formally requested to attend a meeting at the Gilderlook by Duchess Eloise Amberleaf. Please do attend posthaste.`
After some discussion that confirms Lunima has somehow invented sticky notes, the party gets ready for the meeting and go to the Gilderlook. In the strategy room is the duchess, her court, and others, including [[Verzilverd|Zil]].
The duchess starts her speech.
"As I am certain you are all well aware at this point, a week ago a number of chromatic dragon attacks, accompanied by descriptions of supporting ground troops from cultists to kobolds to snake folk, ettin, and in same accounts, dark elves, have been reported across Brazenfell. I've been in contact with our ambassadors from other nations, and there haven't only been attacks in Brazenfell, but around the world."
She continues, "some of you may have noticed that though I have called you all here, there are fewer participants than at prior meetings. Several of our peers have fallen in attacks on outlying towns. Brazenfell as a whole is going to need to undergo changes to respond and prepare ourselves for further attacks. Amberstead has not been idly commanded to do anything- we will be taking initiative in this matter. I understand that we've not had to deal with the threat of war or attack for decades at this point, but with that in mind, we've grown lazy and idle. We need to change if we're going to survive this. Now is the time, I request from all of you as if your noble duty to levy troops, seek spellcasters, and find the mean to fight back. We will be ready for the next strike of this caliber and we shall repell these attacks, and any guerilla attack on our people that comes in the meantime. In addition, I would like to report the return of not only the Drakesbane but our second captain of the guard, Yri."
She motioned to the party. "The rest of the group they are with, the Ironhearts, have earned a reputation, and additionally have expertise in dragon-slaying themselves. They will be useful assets in fighting back, to ensure that through all we face, even in the worst of times, we will not face annihilation by this threat. For the foreseeable future, we will have them ready an available, to keep within the capital. They are our first responders should dragons strike again. I have had a number of sending stones commissioned. As they are completed, they will be sent to each of you so response will be immediate."
The discussion turns to the specifics of levying troops, casters, and magic items, in addition to how the break news of this war to the people.
When the meeting is over, the duchess holds back the Ironhearts.
Duchess: "I would not have leveraged such a request upon you in such a manner, but these are dire times. I ultimately have little power to keep you here if you decide not to, but I request not just for me but for the people that you remain on call to respond if attacks continue on the borders. I know not how the foe intends to strike. It may be all at once, as before. It may continue as the occasional raid, as reports come in. I only ask that you be here. I'll understand if you say no, but the people need you. They need heroes."
The Ironhearts agree to stay. Aeri introduces herself to the duchess and the party explains that Jenga is off on a personal errand.

Duchess: "Aeri, pardon me for assuming, but you travel with the Ironhearts, that means you are of some skill."
Aeri confirms that she does know how to fight, though she hasn't traveled much with the party.
Duchess: "There is an open position in the baronies, and you are of draconic descent."
She asks if Aeri would like to have a noble title, and Aeri considers it before accepting. 

The party leaves, but Zil pulls aside Aeri to a balcony overlooking the [[Gilderflow]].
Zil: "So. My eyes may fool me, but my insticts do not-"
Aeri: "They don't."
Z: "What's your full name?"
A: "Segnisaeris. It's good to meet you."
Z: "I assume... I understand your companions are not aware of your true nature."
A: "It would make things more complicated."
Z: "More complicated?"
A: "I'm stuck like this right now. I don't wanna explain that I can't change back."
Z: "Stuck like this? I understand. If they have not been informed, I will not break a secret. My question is- pardon my snooping- I heard you were being nominated to a barony?"
A: "Something like that."
Z: "As you're new to this political ongoing, well, I'm quite new to being a draconic patron. Only recently have settlements been set up, mine was recent when these attacks began. I'm able to fend off attackers, but that leaves no one to lead my people. They came under dire threat. I do not distrust the duchess to appoint an apt and capable baron to overlook the land I protect, but it would ease my nerves to know I had a fellow dragon aiding me."
A: "Even though I'm stuck like this?"
Z: "You're still a dragon."
A: "It's been a week like this. It's not fun."
Z: "No, I'm comfortable in my human form but I wouldn't want to not stretch my wings."
A: "Manifested ones are not the same thing."
Z: "Yes, I assume if you could beak out of this you would have already."
A: "Yeah. The Copper Dragonlord stuck me like this."
Z: "Then it's a fruitless endeavor to undo, but I may be able to alleviate things. Do I have your permission to request you be assigned as the baroness of the land I overlook?"
A: "That would be great, may make things easier for me."
Z: "I will formally put in a request."
He pulls a crumpet from his bag and starts eating it. 
Z: "Chromatic dragons returning. The kind of thing only existing as a nesting story. Like a nightmare manifest to see it happening in our lifetimes. Especially... I'm not an old dragon, barely over a century to my name. It's terrifying."
A: "Yeah... I was in Menagerie during the attack. Not fun. I felt pretty hopeless."
Z: "I'd been here longer when the attack came. Well, not that long. I'm from the western fringes of [[Pelagius]]. Nice enough but there's a lot of fighting there, mostly over petty things. I wanted a more purposeful existence than keeping a squabbling noble fom having a head chopped off when they tried stealing another's things, so I came here, and so long the peace lasted."
A: "Until now."
Z: "True. Well, I look forward to a fruitful partnership." 
He leaps up, out of sight, and soon is in his dragon form, flying onto the roof over Aeri.
A: "Show off."
Z: "One last thing." He reaches out a claw and Aeri holds her hand under it. He drops a crumpet into her palm.

The party returns to the estate and the weekend passes uneventfully. Aeri modifies her purse and helps Ruey garden. Larry makes a water lens and explores the gun. Aeri tells the party everything she knows about red dagons. Gold dragons are suited to defeat them because they are fire immune and have a secondary breath weapon. Supposedly, the mortal champion of the [[Gold Dragonlord]] was known to be skilled at killing them with the help of an artifact they had.
Bureizu suspects the artifact in question to be [[Castra Aureum]]. The party decides to speak to the duchess and get leave to go to Soldaten and Shenjin.

The party gifts Aeri with an Ironheart amulet made of copper.

It's decided that Aeri, Finnwell, and any others not going will stay in Amberstead. Sarya, Larry, Yri, and Bureizu will travel to try and get Castra Aureum.
The party goes to see the duchess.

Duchess: "Wonderful timing. Normally I'd have more pomp and circumstance about this. Your recommendation-" she speaks to Aeri- "I've picked out an opening for you, and would like to declare you to be baroness- Do you have a last name?"
Aeri: "No. Can I pick one?"
D: "Yes. Or you could take that of the land you're the baroness of, which would make you Baroness Silverkeep."
Aeri picks the name "Aeri of Silverkeep."
The duchess hands her a deed and a pendant with the emblem of Silverkeep. It's an icon of a silver castle with four peaks on a golden field, with a copper border. Aeri puts it on. The ducehss asks that she bows, and Aeri does so.
Duchess: "Do you, Aeri, vow your service to I, Duchess Eloise Amberleaf as your charge, and to the people of Silverkeep as your wards, and the Duchy of Amberstead as your home, and to Brazenfell as your land?"
Aeri: "Yeah, I do."
Duchess: "Do you promise to hold yourself to the standard of a dragon, in all things and all aspects of life?"
Aeri: "I do."
Duchess: "Do you promise, should this land come under threat, to rally troops in its defense?"
Aeri: "I do."
Duchess: "Then I deem you Baroness Aeri of Silverkeep."
She then tells Aeri, "you do not need to stay within the barony, but I request that you spend next week visiting and surveying it." Then, to the party, "I assume the rest of you have not come on idle business?"

The party convinces her that going to Soldaten for gun metal and to Shenjin for an artifact is useful. The duchess knows of Castra Aureum and thinks they would be foolish to not seek it out. She warns it may be hard to obtain, as Shenjin has also been dealing with attacks.

Zil comes as an escort to bring Aeri to Silverkeep. She gets a ride on his back.

The rest of the party gets teleported by [[Milo the Meticulous|Milo]] and end up in some sort of underground chamber of dwarven make. Outside, they encounter steps heading up the outside of a barren crag. A few hundred meters downstream is the city of [[Masonport]]. The guards let them pass, and the party arrives at the [[Soldaten Embassy]].

They meet a uniformed hobgoblin named [[Albrecht Botschafter]]. He says it has been many moons since their first communication, but the opportunity has not expired, it's "more available, if anything."

Albrecht: "I got your letter of apology, you had pressing business, I'm not holding that against you and I intend to start with a clean slate. Soldaten is looking for brilliant minds. Guild inventors, creative sorts, those who can push forward the bounds of technology. From what we've seen of your arrows, they have great combat potential and the potential for civilian use as well. With lower pressure, they could be used to fight fire."
Larry: "We used them for that purpose, funny that you mention that."
A: "We also noticed that you have a cannon in your possession, I suspect not for idle show. It nears the cutting edge of black powder technology we have. Have you anything else in terms of high grade black powder weaponry?"
L: "Yeah, so, we met some technologically advanced people, they claim to be from a place far from here. They have what they call a flintlock musket. The main innovation is the flintlock, it uses steel to strike flint, and makes sparks to light the powder. It doesn't require an open flame. Sort of a form of hand-cannon."
"We've produced hand-cannons before. if it requires (?) fuel, it will reduce the manufacturing cost. Do you have one, or have you beheld it?"
L: "They were generous enough to give us a sample."
Larry shows Albrecht the musket.
A: "By the gods. When you said you had a- when I said hand cannon, I meant a large unwieldy thing, this is narrow as a staff. How much power could it possibly hold?"
Larry offers a demonstration and the group heads outside the city. Up on the windy cliffs are scarecrow dummies with rusted metal plates over them. Larry aims and fires. Hobgoblins are used to cannon-fire, but such a noise from such a small thing is still surprising.
Albrecht: "That's pierced the thinnest sheet metal. You could pierce that with a good glaive, though. Keep going."
Larry shoots another one. He pierces the metal. 
A: "That's a fair bit more impressive. It's high enough grade metal that an arrow can't piece it. Really only hand-held crossbows in terms of handheld weaponry."
The next shot proves that the musket holds up to hand-cannon standards, and while the final shot won't puncture any metal, it still exceeds anything the hobgoblins can manufacture with that degree of fire and control. Albrecht asks Larry to share more ideas, which he is happy to do so. They discuss the production of gunmetal, something that Soldaten is capable of doing with some time on their hands. Larry could learn the recipe for it in exchange for knowledge of the handguns.
This half of the party would be sent to another city by boat, but many people distrust Soldaten due to their alliance with the blue dragonflight. So they will be teleported to [[Flyhold]] once they can do so.

Jumping back to the party back in Amberstead: 
Aeri is doing work in Silverkeep. It's a single village set along a river, upstream of the actual keep. The population is 500 and growing. Some of the surrounding forest is destroyed, with trees snapped by ice. Zil tells Aeri that white dragons attacked.
Aeri debates levying taxes, but it's winter and she doesn't know how taxes work, so she can't be bothered.

Gymmy researches dragons

Ruey explores the forest and finds acid burns (left from Aeri's hunting, but she doesn't know that) she tells Finnwell about her concerns.
They get a squad to look at the burns. Trees are melted, there are gorges in the ground. Along a hiking trail with coins pressed into stumps to mark the paths, the copper pieces are noticeably missing.

When the workweek ends, the teleportation to Soldaten happens. This part of the party enters through an iron gate and heads down a road through dense jungle. There are massive red sandstone walls down the road, in layers of cannons and troops. There are well defended spaces to walk, and lively streets with merchants and houses. Most of the people are hobgoblin and bugbear but there are also humans, dwarves, tabaxi, and halflings.

Albrecht takes them into the keep to a war room to meet [[Melchor Heimatherr]], one of the two highest ranking people in the country. He deals with tech and development. 
Melchor: "So, Albrecht, who have you brought to me today?"
Albrecht: "This man here," he motions to Larry, "independently developed impressive technology involving the manipulation of water for a variety of purposes. He's also in possession of the understanding of mechanisms behind the most compact black powder weapon I've ever beheld."
Larry: "It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, your honor."
M: "It's a pleasure to make yours. Start with your own work, what's this I hear of water manipulation technology? is it magic or mundane?"
L: "It's a mix of both. It utilizes the orb make when Dust of Dryness, a magic item, dries up in water. The orb is put in the head of a crossbow bolt or arrow in a mechanism that shatters the sphere when it hits something solid like the enemy or a wall, releasing a lot of water."
Larry shows off his various inventions, and is able to make a deal with the Heimatherr.

Meanwhile, Aeri returns to Amberstead for the week, painting googly eyes on everything, and Ruey continues exploring the woods.
