The copper dragonlord finds the party.
"Before you go, I would like to speak with you all."
She takes the form of a human with copper skin, and looks remarkably like the thief who stole Lunima's manuscript.
Lunima: "I took two months to write it, I got an editor- and you stole it from under my nose!"
Aeramen: "I spell-checked it!"
Lunima: "Aggressively!"
Aeramen: "Yes, at high speed."
Lunima: "...Fair enough, but a warning in the future!"

The dragonlord [[Aeramen]] informs the Ironhearts that there are reports of other attacks in the world. Dragons and cultists seem to be attacking major cities. She acknowledges that they have a home to defend. 
"One last request, if you don't mind. I have an acquaintance who's not in a great place right now, partially due to the attacks and other things, and I'd like for you to take them under your wing for the time being. I will go an retrieve them."

She leaves. In the meantime, Bureizu examines the box he got from a drow in Hell. He reasons that it must be important the party muses that Tiamat must be allied with the lolthites.
The box is opened. Jenga realizes that her necklace to track Shava is glowing. Set in the box like a body in a coffin is a drow in a silken dress of spider silk. She is missing an eye and an ear, but it's definitely [[Shava]].
The Regenerate spell doesn't work on the eye. Detect Magic doesn't pick up anything, and a magic dispelling pellet fails to have any affect. Shava doesn't wake when shook, and all a healing potion does is make her fever subside. On further inspection, there is runing around her head and even runes on the inside of the lid over her missing eye. Lots of them are for abjuration purposes, some are ritualistic, and others made wards against healing.

The dragonlord returns with a girl who is similarly toned, with short curly black hair, hazel eyes, and copper scales over her skin. She wears a green shirt with a strap over it, simple shorts held with a belt, and a green cloak. She looks rather pissed. This is [[Aeri]].
(Note: Aeri served as a temporarily replacement for Jenga while Tess took a break from playing Jenga).

Sarya asks a favor of the dragonlord.
S: "From what I'm aware- Well, I'm aware of the rumors surrounding you. That you're immortal, you've conquered death, or have some connections, that sort of thing. I was wondering..."
A: "Reports of my dealing with the dead are greatly exaggerated. I've lived this long through wit and cunning, not through making Menahem mad."
S: "Do you have any connection to him?"
A: "Not in particular. You've spoken with him and his proxies more than I have. If you're interested in rumors of immortality, head north of here."
S: "I'm not interested in that anymore, more interested in.... my..."
A: "Cheating death?"
S: "My recently deceased wife."
A: "Have you tried resurrection?"
S: "Her soul is already gone."
A: "If she does not wish to return, I don't know what I'm supposed to tell you."
S: "I spoke to her one last time when I died on the battlefield and was hoping you could help me fulfill her last request to clear my name."
A: "Clear your name of what?"
S: "It was... Assumed by me and other people as well who knew my wife that I drove her into offing herself. But when I spoke to her, she said she died because of being stupid and defiant, and she decided to dance on the Faeriesteps. According to her."
A: "(Unclear in notes)- I suggest you head north if you wish to have conclusive results in that department. There is an enclave, one of the remenants of [[Volnia]]. There resides wood elven priestesses who know much about the afterlife. At minimum, they could ensure that what you speak is true."
Aeramen goes on to say, "beyond that... I hate being official. Resolve whatever business you have, I'll have you teleported home soon as you're done."
She gives Lunima a necklace with the crest of Menagerie on it to use as an object for Teleport.

Sarya decides to confront her sister-in-law. The party joins in the form of birds under a shape-change spell. The east gate is now a pile of rubble with lots of bodies. Where the sand has turned to glass in flaming breath, however, there is a break, as if someone has stopped the flame with a cloak. From that point on there are signs of someone fleeing into the desert.

Jenga goes to [[The Thousand Sands Hotel]] and digs through the wreckage. Most bodies are burnt passed recognition,but she finds the ashes of [[Katya]]. 

The party loots the red dragon, then takes a long rest.
During the rest, Jenga has a dream from her patron Lorcan. He first tells her that he knows someone who could heal Shava, but they're in a distant land, so she would have to part ways for the party for a bit. He then says that his network lit up the night before, with attacks happening across the globe. There was an attack in Brazenfell, and while it's unknown which city exactly, most reports say [[Brazenhold]].

The next morning, Jenga bids her farewell to the party. Instead of teleporting with the rest of them, she will return to the Lady Ferrum and set sail.

The party, with Aeri as a new member, gets teleported back to the marble gazebo in [[Amberstead]]. Everything there looks fine. They approach the south gate, and the guards look excited to see Finnwell, calling him by his title Drakesbane and hurrying him to enter. The party meets [[Duchess Eloise Amberleaf]], who is currently in mostly ceremonial partial armor. She says that soon after the party left, there were reports of dragonfire scorching villages to the north, including [[Elding Outpost]] on the border. She asks the Ironhearts to stay nearby in case an attack happens on Amberstead, and bid Yri to help the guard train soldiers.

Aeri gets Lunima to stick her hand in her coin purse, and Lunima is damaged by acid. When Lunima points out that it's enough acid to kill a normal person, Aeri decides to alter it. She now shares a room with Lunima but takes a liking to Sarya and goes shopping with her. Sarya is very confused when Aeri pays 200 gold for health potions by dumping out from her purse *exactly* 20,000 copper pieces.
