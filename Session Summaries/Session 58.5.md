A between-sessions interraction with mainly Jenga, Haz, and Ruey (aka Tess Hannah and Sam were in VC and got up to shit)


Jenga is doing potion roulette with Haz, with the poorly labelled potions from the arcane college fair (session 30). Jenga picks one called 'Vanish' and Haz drinks 'Fly'. Everything Jenga is wearing and has equipped seems to evaporate, and Haz goes flying 60 feet into the air and rain, slamming through the ceiling of Jenga's cabin on the ship, and then falls down. He's fine, and the crew covers the hole with a tarp. Jenga, with a blanket wapped aroud her, is now soaked. A hour later, there is a shimmering, and she drops the blanket as she stuff reappears. 
Haz and Jenga go above decks, where Ruey stops the rain. Jenga takes the 'Shock' potion, and her entire body stiffens with static electricity. Haz takes 'Hot' and breathes fire, so Jenga casts Fly on him. They convince Ruey to drink the 'Phillis' potion but she just feels very ill for a minute. 
Jenga: "Want booze? It won't help, but you'll be drunk."
Ruey: "I've never been drunk."
Jenga: "Oh, excellent!"
Haz climbs to the crow nest and falls back down with booze. Jenga tries to convince Ruey to try some.
Ruey: "Am I allowed to do this?"
Jenga: "Is anyone gonna stop you? It's a dumb question. Do you want to?"
Ruey: "Do you want me to?"
Jenga: "That's a dumb response. I just think it'll help."
The peer pressure works, and Ruey drinks a sip of [[Haz's Moonshine]].

They then do drugs. Jenga gets Ruey to make rain and they do [[Sea Nectar]], and proceed to have a great time rolling around on the deck. It's dark out so there's not many crew members watching.

Ruey gives a sunflower to Jenga, who declares that they are best friends now. They hug.

Jenga makes a troubling discovery, and finds that her veins that are prevalent near her bracers have darkened and turn black breifly when she casts Eldritch Blast.
Ruey asks her, "when you died, did it burn?"
"No? That would suck, though." Jenga assumes the question is because she went to hell after dying.

Jenga's familiar Cap meets Naan. Ruey says someone named [[Estrella]] taught her druid magic.
Ruey uses her [[Gray Bag of Tricks]] to summon Smoke the direwolf.
Ruey goes to bed on the deck of the ship. Jenga goes to bed and is confused upon waking to find herself wearing her robe even though she took it off before bed.
