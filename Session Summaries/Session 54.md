The party reaches a treasure room behind the mummy lord. They find a flying palanquin, semi-precious stone spheres, a polished bronze hilt, and there is necromancy detected from jars on the back row. Lunima dispels Glyphs of Warding in the room. The party also fill jars with fire to destroy the mummy remains so it doesn't reform. They find 12,210 electrum, 1538 gold, and 12 gemstones. Also in the loot is a [[Melange Sphere]] and the [[Ioun Stone of Absorbtion]].
Jenga examines the hilt and sees that is was once part of a foci, and is connected to the lower planes. It's familiar to her but she can't place why. Regardless, she takes it.

The party encounters more cultists later on who are looking for their escaped experiments. They have the party line up to bite into clay, which will reveal fangs beyond any disguising spell. When the clay is held in front of Jenga to bite, she bites the hand of the cultists, and a fight starts.

After winning the fight, the party tries to fit in and goes to the sleeping area for a long rest. They get to level up to level 14! 

The party enters the main ritual area, finally. On the altar is a halfling prisoner. Gymmy is there still posing as a cultist and is actually complimented as a good member of the cult, and asked to pick someone to participate in some sort of sacrifice. Fearing this could mean something bad, Finnwell is chosen, in hopes he can handle whatever is coming. Finnwell ends up aging as the sacrifice is performed, and now seems to be an old man. 
Gymmy yells "SUCK MY DICK!" and casts Blight, and the fight starts.

During the fight, Jenga uses her new level 14 feature to send the priestess through the lower planes, doing 78 damage.

The party wins the fight and claims the knife used in the sacifices. It's called the [[Rite Knife]] and is given to Gymmy.
