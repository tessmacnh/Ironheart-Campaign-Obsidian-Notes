Katya knocks on Jenga's door and says that a cloaked wood elf asked for her. Jenga informs the party and then goes downstairs. There is a wood elf there who pulls down her hood. In her hair she wears beads like Jenga, but hers are ceramic. She apologizes for the merchant in the cloak shop yelling at Jenga, and explains that she underpaid for something. She insists on taking Jenga to a cafe for breakfast to make up for it, and Jenga brings Haz along. 
 The wood elf's magic cloak has illusion magic to make her invisible. Jenga gives the sending stone from Haz to Sarya before going with her.
 
 They go to a nearby restaurant. The wood elf introduces herself as [[Tatyana]]. She was apparently here a long time ago visiting family, but it's been some decades since. Jenga introduces herself, and Tatyana recognizes her name from the tournament in Amberstead. She spectated it but didn't get to see the final match. Still, she heard accusations of foul play in Jenga's favor, and she thinks that Zawisza shouldn't have dragged it out.
 Jenga insights this, regarding the realization Tatyana had regarding her name. It's a bit suspicious, and her tone shows that this maybe isn't the realization she had.
 
 Tatyana goes into the bathroom and Jenga is suspicious, so she sends Haz after. He gets kicked out. 
 
 Meanwhile, Sarya is told that someone is here for her. The bellhop isn't the bellhop, it's a wood elf. Lunima tries speaking for them at first.
 Lunima: "I'm here to talk. Are you scared of something?"
 Elf: "I have a discussion to have."
 L: "She's incapacitated at the moment." (Referring to Sarya)
Elf: "Seems she's scared of some sort of punishment."
L: "Mind if you talk to me on behalf of her? I can transcribe via telepathy."
Sarya: "I can speak for myself. I'm just worried that something might happen."
Elf: "If you're an innocent woman, you have no concern. You know exactly what I speak of. Your fear upon my entrance indicates more than I could explain."
S: "Look, all I was told is that there's someone chasing after me, okay? I don't know- You have to clarify, of course I'm terrified if an unknown entity is chasing after me."
L: "I take it you're here... Since... On someone else's behalf?"
Elf: "[[Zoka Starwake|Zoka]]'s behalf. A woman found dead. In the bottom of a gorge known as [[The Faeries' Leap]]."
Sarya's face drops, her eyes fill with tears.
Elf: "My sister."
Sarya bursts into tears. Lunima evacuates the non-leveled NPCs. Sarya enters her winter form.
Elf: "I have questions. You cannot answer them as you are now. Return to me in summer and I shall leave you when my questions have been answered. Do you understand?"
Sarya nods.
Elf: "Feel free to bring an ally. No more than one." She leaves, saying, "and sorry about the bellhop, they're incapacitated for the evening."

Back in the cafe, Tatyana returns from the bathroom.
"Sorry that was a while. Oh, the scones are here!" She says that the scones are worse than last time, and they must have changed the recipe. Tatyana remarks that the Copper Dragonlord is fond of justice via retribution. She also says that she owes Jenga another meal since this one isn't that good. Jenga learns that she has kids(?) but hasn't contacted them in a while. She also seems wistful when the topic of grandchildren was brought up.

On her way back to the hotel, Jenga sees the bellhop unconscious in an alley. Lunima explains what happened to Jenga while Alasha deals with the body. Jenga tries to support Sarya by giving her a blanket and booze. Ruey is a bit more helpful by getting her some water, and Lunima. Sarya asks Lunima to come with her to see the elf again, but first they need to put Sarya into summer form. Lunima puts herself behind a force wall and begins insulting Sarya. 
"The death of your wife didn't even matter. The only people who got upset are you and some obscure person. No one else got upset. Get over yourself."
Sarya enters a trance and soon has orange hair, bright gold skin, and red eyes. The party travels through the streets to go find the elf. 

There are lots of cloaked figures around the square. Suddenly the sky does dark, and from the south are swiftly approaching massive forms. Spells are being chanted around the party as at least a dozen red dragons fly overhead, roaring down jets of flame. Portals open in the square, the city fills with screams, and drow with Lolthite markings fill the streets. In response, 10 copper dragons rise from the streets of Menagerie to counter the attack. The Ironhearts begin to help.

During the fight, more portals open. Drow cultists pose a threat, and a lolthite with red scales on her neck proclaims, "all who dare oppose the matron mother's will, who hide her true kin from her, shall face the consequence."

Sarya died in the combat. There is a flash of fire from overhead, and the [[Copper Dragonlord]] shows up to fight the ancient red dragon, [[Urorex]]. She roars, "face me before you face those under me!" 
The red dragon responds, "gladly."

Jenga sends it briefly to Hell as a portal opens, and from it come two white abishai. Behind them, however, emerging from the portal, is a figure in dark purple tinted armor. A bright green glint glows from one eye. In his hand is a familiar [[Sunblade]], now in a two-handed grasp. He raises it and shouts, "FOR THE STARS!"
The party rejoices: [[Bureizu Uwe|Bureizu]] is back. 

Ruey revived Sarya. Sarya comes back as a College of Swords bard. 
Sarya: "I knew you'd make it back!"
Bureizu: "Was there ever any doubt?"

Haz gets the killing blow on the dragon, and the other red dragons are repelled by the copper ones. The last portal closes, and a lolthite consort says "this is not the end of our war!"

The Ironhearts come out victorious. Bureizu removes his helmet to reveal that one eye has been replaced with a green gem. His hair is longer than normal and he's got stubble on his chin. The party hugs him. He reveals that it's only been 10 days in hell, but the party tells him that it's been two months. They fill him in on everything he's missed.

Sarya reveals that she spoke to her wife when she died. Her wife, she said, is waiting for her on the other side. She didn't die to suicide, she died because after arguing with Sarya about the safety of it, she danced on the 'Faeriesteps' of the gorge, fell in, and died. She wants Sarya to clear her name and live a good life.

Bureizu shares his tale of being in Hell. When he went through the portal, he saw a big and a small portal. He tried to close them, but the demons reopened them. He almost died in that fight, and lost his eye. There were erinyes trying to kill the demons, so he helped them, but went unconscious. When he awoke, he was in the prison of sorts, but was able to leave it. He found his way to [[Zariel]] and has a conversation with her. They strike a deal where Zariel will get him out of Hell if he helps fight demons. Buriezu fights the demon [[Shaibane]],  the same one he fought in the [[Demon Mines]], lots of other monsters, and had a mission to protect a Hellfire Engine. An infernal commander, [[Mox]], took him back to Zariel. Bureizu made a request to travel to the Abyss to finish off Shaibane, and Zariel approves of it. He got a new eye from a 'witch lady' (it was a hag), and got new armor with a strengthening enchantment. She then let him go to the Abyss with someone named [[Lorcan]].
Jenga asks to clarify, "tall, red, horns, black feathered wings?" She confirms that this is indeed her patron. 
Bureizu continues to explain. They went to the Abyss, he learned that Lorcan was born on the material to a drunk father who fucked a devil, came to hell by some misfortune, and it was a rather sad story but they plan on meeting up in a tavern in Amberstead. Jenga thinks this is possible, since Lorcan met with them for brunch. Sarya tells him that they now have contingencies in place with Lorcan, but if they use all three of them, their souls are automatically sold. 
Bureizu in hell then fought spiders in the Abyss, and met a drow named [[Zawisza|Black]]. She was a bard with a strong personality and was a probably-ex-lolthite. He speaks highly of her, and she helped him get out of hell. They both killed Shaibane together. Bureizu harvested what he could to bring back to Zariel. There was a humanoid shape in spider silk they left behind (this could have possibly been Shava, but Bureizu would have had no reason to bother getting her). Zariel gave Bureizu a final objective. Devils of [[Tiamat]] were causing an issue on the material. Bureizu was to go to the material to shut down whatever they were up to, as he evidently has. After that discussion with Zariel, she made sure his replacement eye was set properly. He had another conversation with Black on the battlefield, then met a drow working for Lolth, killed the drow and took the bag she carried because it's probably important. Black had said there was a power struggle, and a lolthite priestess liked the girl that the Ironhearts saved, which caused a fuss. Buriezu and Black met a final time at the open portal, where Black caused a distraction to give him enough time to go through.

Rejoiced to have their friend back, the party finds a hotel to stay in since the previous one they were at had burned in the fire.
