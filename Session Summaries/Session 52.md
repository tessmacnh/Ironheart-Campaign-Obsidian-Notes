The now united party travels through a room of disorienting fog that is dispelled by Sarya. A strange trap involving a sword in the ceiling does harm them, however. They almost are caught by a trap door near the ritual chambers.
In he ritual chambers, the party finds bodies being experimented on, and they find Jenga and Haz to be undead and vampiric. They fight and defeat vampire-Jenga and vampire-Haz, and then cast Raise Dead to bring them back.
Jenga gets her spellbook back and the party sees some patrols leaving the temple. Safe for now, they take a long rest.
