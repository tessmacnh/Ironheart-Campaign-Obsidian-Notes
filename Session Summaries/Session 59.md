Jenga has a dream from Lorcan. He gives her more information about the thief he wants her to catch, as well as actions to take afterwards. Jenga asks him about her veins and the bracers, and he explains that curses placed by fiends tend to be worse than mundane once and that the curse on the bracers will worsen with time, and become more painful. He talks to her a bit about Jenga's activities in Prospero, and the dream ends.

[[Fortuna]] is an hour away, and the party passes some buildings on the coast. It's going from sandy beaches to a marshy terrain. Fortuna is at the very edge of where a town could be put without sinking. [[Azurport]] is two weeks past Fortuna.

Haz explains to Yri that he broke the wood of the deck but the crew fized it with a tarp. Jenga asks Gymmy to take a look at her bracers but he isn't of much help.

The party draws into port. The crew goes off and Yri and Haz find a place to duel. They get to a forest grove and start fighting. Haz nearly wins, hiding in trees and shooting down, but Yri continuously fells the trees and manages to win the duel.

Jenga argues with Lunima about the validity of her pact magic. Lunima argues that instant gratifaction is bad, and brings up that Jenga is evil and thus can wear the [[Robes of the Archmagi]]. She tries to get Jenga to study wizard magic with her, but Jenga, feeling insulted and not enjoying learning, refuses.

Sarya prepares for a seance. She plays a haunting tune, touches [[Menahem]]'s holy symbol, and falls into a trance as she plays on the [[Dukh Ocarina]]. After, she says she was speaking to a god, but doesn't know if she can share what she learned, only saying it has to do with the past she told them about.
Jenga's like "hey I have drugs that do the same thing" referring to [[Magic Drugs|Psychopomp]], a drug that kills you with the effects of a Commune spell and brings you back automatically.

Lunima apologizes to Jenga for insulting her magic, and then questions her, and says she knows Jenga can cast Demiplane and wants to learn the spell, so she wants to see Jenga cast it. Jenga for Jenga reasons deflects the question, and eventually confesses that she has some *interesting* things in her demiplane, and proceeds to ask Lunima is she's ever gotten 'The Talk'. There is then argument over who gives Lunima the Talk, and it finally goes to Gymmy.
"Ok, so you're gonna find a space in the woods, and start digging-"
Everyone: "WRONG TALK!"
Jenga: "No, like, I mean sex."
He tries again. "So sometimes if you wanna get close to someone in order to stab them, you have to make sure they're in a weak and vulnerable position-"
It's not Yri's turn.
"Lunima can I pull you aside?"
"Sure, bet."
"Sarya said you needed the Talk."
"I dunno what that means, I thought Jenga asked if I was a sex worker."
"You're aware of what intercourse is?"
"Yes, I'm aware, why?"
Yri explains that that's what the 'Talk' is. It's finally cleared up that Lunima has gotten the Talk but didn't know it was called 'the Talk'.

The party goes to a job board and finds a job to catch a thief for the [[Brandybeard Orchard and Vineyard]].
On the way there, Lunima insists that she's human, which is a bit odd.
The party meets [[Byron Brandybeard]] who explains the situation.
"We've had a problem recently with a thief coming to the property on a recurring basis, at various locations, stealing wine, gold, valuables, you name it. We thought it was a mundane fox, and hired mercenaries to ward them off for a couple of days, but they kept coming, apparently they've used magic to aid their exploits. I've lost a great deal of gold to this bastard, and I've yet to see their face." He shows a map of the orchard. "Here are the orchards and vineyard, but they're not taking fruit off the field. They've been going after three locations. The treasury, the alehouse, and assaulting wagons going into the estate directly. We have reports of them disguising as a mercenary, turning invisible, creating fog, and manifesting weapons from shadow. We are willing to pay a great deal of coin to have them caught, and tip a barrel of our finest reserve."
The party says they are up for the challenge.
Byron: "I don't know where they attack on any given night, there's no pattern. If you overfocus your efforts on one location they might strike another. You'll have my hired blades at your disposal, and additionally, if you need funds I will supply some, it will come from your final paycheck."
He says he suspects the thief to be a tabaxi, as clawmarks have been found, though those could be from a magical transformation.

Jenga resummons her familiar Cap the cat as Bottle the owl. She sends him patrolling with orders to cry once for a disturbance at the treasury, twice for the alehouse, and 3 times for the road.

Sarya and Larry investigate the treasury. There are scratches on a chest's lock suggesting that a skilled lockpick opened them. This isn't an inside job if there was no key forged. No signs of struggle are found, but potentially some blood from a head hitting the ground? Sand on the ground has residual transmutation magic and suggests that a sleep spell incapacitated the guards. Footprints belong to a medium creature.

Jenga and Finnwell check out the road. It gets lots of wagon traffic and there are ruts from the wheels. If someone were to grab a wagon it would have to be done outside the estate. There are hints of claw-shredded canvas from a wagon that haven't been there for more than a few days, and more sand from a sleep spell. There's a straight peice of iron in a ditch, which Finnwell says was from a Hold Person spell.

Everyone meets at the alehouse. There is fleece on the ground from a casting of Major Image. There's no signs of forced entry but there is a divot in the ground leading to a hollow barrel that gives entry into the brewhouse. Jenga casts Alarm on it. 
The last attack was a week ago, on the wagons, and some wards and alarms were manually dispelled.

Sarya does a spirit session to get the spell Arcane Eye.
As night falls, Jenga and Finnwell go to the road, Sarya and Larry go to the alehouse, and Gymmy and Yri guard the treasury.

A wagon comes in with a shipment. It's being driven by a tabaxi but seems to be legit. Bottle sees guards going to their posts, but there's no other traffic. Some workers have gone from for the night, others are being escorted out. The wagon Jenga tracks seems to have a hole matching the canvas scrap she has, meaning it's legit. She returns to the road.
Everything is fine come midnight. Gymmy notices candles lit in the farmhouse that shouldn't be. There is glass shattering and the party bolts to the farmhouse to find every candlestick and piece of silverware missing from the room they were debriefed in, the back window smashed, the guards in the interior asleep, and one of them missing. They realize that none of the guards were profiled, and Larry notices illusion magic where the other guard had been standing. The party tracks it around the barrack but it vanishes. Manual tracking takes them to a building, where the trail abruptly stops.

The party plans a trap. Jenga will scan all the guards for magic, and Sarya advises a crowd. Jenga's [[Statue Set]] will be used as bait for the thief.

They wake the next morning to a very upset Byron Brandybeard, but now they have a plan to catch the thief.
