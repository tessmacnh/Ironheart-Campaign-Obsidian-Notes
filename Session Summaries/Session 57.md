The party gets to [[Prospero]].

The notetaking here is off. I as notetaker missed this session and so had a seperate one-on-one with Sam to determine what my character did. Most of Jenga's activities in Prospero I currently cannot disclose, as this will be shared with all members of the party eventually, but this will be updated post-campaign to include them. Needless to say, Jenga was Jenga and did some dumb shit, some weird shit, and possibly made some enemies. She also does a surprising amount of self-reflection.

NOTES SUPPLIED BY JACKSON (reformatted/summarized by Tess, obv.):

The party arrives at Prospero and gets repairs on the ship. Lunima, Sarya, and the crew (Arn and Yewande) find food at [[A Taste of Scales]].

Larry and Finnwell find a magic item shop run by a scary woman and for 1200 gold buy a set of aquamarines that can possibly control water.
They get cannonballs, enjoy the food, and find a book store. Lunima finds a fictional book about a copper dragon. Lunima finds a book on Bladesinger wizards. She doesn't buy any but is now determined to write her own book.
The party means a friend/associate of Gymmy's named Giornio who is suspicious and sells poison, which Finnwell buys some of.

A fire breaks out in Prospero. The party works to save people and put the fire out. They meet Jenga back at the ship, there is some confusion regarding the succubus but Jenga is also clearly high out of her mind on drugs.

%%there was a between session thing here i did with sam to be added later (the one where things went horribly wrong u know the one tess)%%
