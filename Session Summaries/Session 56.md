The party returns to town, forming a crowd as they go through. They are met by the council of nagas. 
"We are in your debts forever, Ironhearts. You have liberated this island from the foul creature that has been in control of it for so long. As you'd expect, a great many people wish to leave the island. We can offer no payment ourself but you may keep what you claimed, and we can offer you our hospitality. Additionally, we've discussed with a number of our people, and while most are leaving using ships of our own, a number wish to join your crew. You've no obligation to accept them, but it's their way of offering thanks. If you ever need shelter you are free to come here, likewise if you need council or guidance. You've learned yourself a life debt from a group of creatures who have no natural end."

Jenga goes to speak to wood elves, wanting to learn more about them. She finds a group of them. A young man, a woman, and a small child.
The man, [[Arn]], talks to her.
"I didn't come here from the mainland myself, but my parents did, a long time ago. They've told me tales of our people. They say the wood elves call themselves a different name, it's been a few hundred years, uh-" he thinks, "they called themselves the [[Voln'i]]. Once they were in conflict with dragons, and peace came due to a number of treaties. They had no enemies within their lands, the continent of [[Volnia]] known now as [[Aesager]]. They dedicated themselves to magic, two schools of it. Of course, this dedication was at the expense of devotion to the pantheon of gods that watch over the elves. They thought they needed no protection since there had no outside enemies or internal conflict. They spent time researching transmutation and necromancy. They believed themselves to be able to- Well, I'm aware of the extent of necromancers, nothing against them, both parents of mine were skilled necromancers. They disagreed with their peers and they knew that bringing themselves too close to the source of a necromancer, the negative plane, is inherently more risky than the other Voln'i believed it to be. More importantly, they didn't believe that the Voln'i should have been indulging themselves in exposing third parties to the negative plane in large quantities. You recognize that, at least since my parents left the mainland, there aren't many wood elves around here? Turns out that while they believed they had no threats, Volnia's biggest threat was its own people, and their recklessness. They were careless, and unleashed a plague upon themselves. While supposedly most of the wood elves died, there are conclaves left. My parents lived through all of that. While the Voln'i learned their lesson as far as tinkering with the negative plane went, their response was to restrict themselves to enclaves far from former cities. My parents didn't agree with that, it's why they left. For a few hundred years they kept out of the world, and others came to Volnia. My parents didn't harm them, they researched spirits in a different sense. other wood elves made a bad reputation for the people as a whole. As such, they were forced to seek sanctuary and found that in Notos. Yet, their past could not leave them behind and- Well, it's not correct to say that they brought the cult here, as that happened hundreds of years later, they came here before Notos (note: perhaps meant Boros?) fell to it's current state. My parents died fighting the cult. I know a bit more about wood elven culture, though I don't know a lot. You are one of the Ironhearts, no?"
Jenga confirms that she is.
"I intend to join your vessel, if you'd welcome us."
"Of course!"
"My name is [[Arn]]. I was intending to join your crew anyways."
He bids her farewell in Elvish.
 
 The ship now has a divine ward around it, and there is a figure in white silk robes on the deck maintaining the spell, accompanied by a figure in leather amor and a hood. Likely these are Lia and Thiala.
 
 Jenga bribe Yri into giving her the [[Iron Flask]], trading him a mithril ingot and some alcohol. 
 
 The party takes a long rest and levels up to level 15!
 
 The ship gets more crew members, and the nagas brew a potion for Finnwell to cure his old age. Not only will his body no longer age but he now shares some of the naga's blood. 
 The naga says, "I humbly request you take our mission of protecting the weak and outcasts, guarding the oppessed. Already, you as a group have proven willing to do such things."
 
 Before departing, Lunima puts a sign on the island warning of a minefield. The ship departs, with new abjured sails woven with scales.
 
 A ship comes in the opposite direction of us, called the Radiant Moonbeam. The captain is a triton.
 "Greetings from our Lord and Savior, [[Sir Merichias the Fifth]]. There is a merchant tax." He explains that we need to pay or have our cargo inspected. Jenga mentions that the party killed a lich and cleared the storm over [[Isle Boros]], and he lets the cargo investigation slide. The party is escorted to the shore and arrive in the port of [[Lustreo]].
 
 Jenga has a dream from [[Lorcan]], who gives her instructions regarding a thief she is to help catch in Fortuna. He also tells her to get the bronze hilt she found to Caelynn, who will use it to impove her [[Rod of the Pact-Keeper]].
 %%hey tess add here more later post-campaign%%
 Upon waking Jenga gives it to Clarity to teleport it to Amberstead.
 Down the coast from Lustreo is [[Prospero]] and [[Fortuna]].
 
 Jenga, Yri, and Lunima go to a bar called [[Leaf and Liquor]], made of large fused together trees.
 They encounter [[Zawisza]].
 
 Suddenly, a person literally falls from the roof. It is a woman with fluffy gray hair, dark skin like a drow, gold pupil-less eyes, a flower crown, and who is dressed in druidic clothing.
 She talks in Sylvan to Zawisza, saying, "the sky's not the right color. Where are we?"
 Zawisza responds with "love, you're not- You're on the material."
 "How?"
 
 This person is from the Feywild, and she turns back to the tree hoping that whatever portal she came through is still open, but it doesn't work. The wood elf who runs the establishment speaks Druidic with her.
 
 This is a wildfire druid named [[Ruey]], who the party takes in to travel with them. Jenga pays for a bit of everything on the menu, and it's a fine mix of elven and druidic cuisine.
 
 Ruey isn't a drow, and it's unclear what exactly she is. The group enjoys some delicious food with her.
 
 %%tess you know why this note is here just check ur notes lol%%
 
 The party returns to the ship after filling up on rations and leftovers, and Jenga tells the party about the job to catch a thief. 
 Jenga also gives Shava's [[Rosepin of Guises]] to Ruey, and when she puts it on, she appears as Shava last did. Jenga has to excuse herself for a moment and goes below decks.
 
 The party agrees to join Jenga for the thief-catching mission. Ruey reveals that she has a wildfire spirit, a lion cub made of fire named [[Naan]]. Jenga finds out that Haz thinks she is mad at him, or not wanting him, so they hug it out. He reveals that when he died, he ran away from a man in the city of the dead because he didn't want to be a weasel. Jenga tells him, "hey, I may ask you to be out of our room for a bit."
 "You is having many secrets. Talk to big horned man."
 "...Yup that's totally why," Jenga responds, fully intending to do questionable things with the succubus trapped in the Iron Flask. Haz decides he wants to sleep in the crows nest anyways.
 
 Sarya lets slip to Lunima that Jenga's made a deal with a fiend, and Lunima becomes a bit wary. Jenga gets mad at Sarya, saying that this is exactly why she doesn't tell people, they'd "get the wrong idea."
 
 Sarya has some sort of a dream that night. The next morning she asks a favor of Jenga, asking that when they go to Amberstead, Jenga ensures she doesn't go anywhere alone.
 
 On the 22nd, there is a storm ahead. The party gets through it, and Yri trades Haz 700 silver in exchange for Gauntlets of Ogre Strength (Haz got them from Morrowzeer).
 Ruey turns into a dolphin to swim with some of them and Jenga jumps in as well.
 
 The party fights some sharks, Flies befriends Lunima, Jenga discovers that the succubus' name is [[Lilux]] and also that the crewmates who got something made from the harpy feathers apparently paid for a pillow recreation of a harpy with clothing on, stuffed in an empty ship container.
