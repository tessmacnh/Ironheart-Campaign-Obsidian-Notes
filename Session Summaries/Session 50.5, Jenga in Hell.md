For Jenga, everything is a haze with long moments of dark.

She finds herself in an unfamiliar city scape. A figure approaches and looks at her with pity. Jenga doesn't like it. They beckon for her to follow.

She isn't sure how, but she ends up in Lorcan's chambers. Unlike the blurriness of her dreams, she can see them properly now. It's a surprisingly small room with a desk, and two doors on either side. The desk is well made, and the room is very warm. It's largely made of dark stone and a wood she cannot identify.

Lorcan is sitting at the desk, wearing a poker face.
L: "Today has been eventful, hasn't it?"
J: "...I'm dead. I am dead, right?"
L: (sarcastically) "I didn't notice."
L: "In any case, I am going to tell you something I normally wouldn't tell people who make arrangements with me. You are more valuable to me alive than as a soul in a collection. You being not alive puts a wrinkle in things. Should your companions not have revived you at this point, I would have done it myself- I have access to such magic- but it seems you picked quite the foe to croak against. I have no quarrels with necromancers but they make things a bit difficult. For now, especially since these groups of necromancers seem to be cautious and warded the place against dimensional travel..." He trails off. "Now, as much as I'd love to continue idly talking, a much better way to spend time is by watching. Let's see what your friends are doing."

Lorcan sets a crystal ball on his desk. Within, Jenga can see her friends currently staring at a door.
L: "Hopefully they're able to find your material vessel in a state with I can return you to it, or they can do it themselves. In the meantime... I would ask if you're preferential to catering, but you're not material enough."
J: "Can I eat? Drink?" 
Jenga realizes she has no body and also finds that she has a 360 degree field of view, cannot move, and cannot technically speak, rather, Lorcan has heard her thoughts this whole time.
J: "FUCK. GOD DAMMIT. I mean... This is fine."
L: "Things moving forward ought to be pretty interesting."

After some exchanged conversation regarding what her friends are doing, Lorcan says that while he can't offer her cooking from Hell, there are other kinds of entertainment.
Before deciding that, Jenga asks what will happen if the party doesn't recover her body, and Lorcan says they will cross that bridge when they come to it. He also says Jenga has an option to get a body in Hell if she wants and asks if she plans on dying often. Jenga says adventuring seems to be dangerous so it's possible. 

Jenga wants to see comedy in Hell but comedy shows in Hell suck. Then she thinks 'hmm gladitorial combat sounds like something they have in Hell that could be kinda entertaining' but that's more like 2 succubi fighting to the death in Lorcan's office and it's honestly more awkward than anything. The succubi however are very attractive even covered in blood and Jenga asks if they know how to dance. They do.

Jenga, once she gets her body in Hell, learns how to pole dance from the succubi and gains proficiency in the skill.

Also while in Hell, Jenga has some *fun times* with some tieflings. These include [[Iva]], a shy purple tiefling; [[Amon]], a bold red tiefling; [[Eris]], a blue tiefling who Jenga doesn't actually do much with (though they shared a tender moment below a magical skylight, showing Eris the stars for the first time) but helps her get a job as Lorcan's accountant; [[Deo]], a kinda twink yellow tiefling; and finally, [[Clara]], and orange tiefling who did nothing but insult Shava. Jenga got so infuriated with her remarks that she found herself wanting to kill Clara. She thinks to Lorcan, "_Lorcan, if there are any horrible consequences to killing this bitch, now would be a fantastic time to let me know cause I'm real fucking tempted let me tell you_."
He responds with _"...nothing I can't waive."_

MESSAGES FROM DISCORD DMs

Jenga grins a bit. She flips the knife in her hand as she gets closer and closer to Clara with every step.

_Clara through the paralysis holds this smug sneer. She clearly doesn't think you'll go through with it._

"I normally keep my promises. But to make you suffer the amount I want you to would take too long. I think I'll just do the hells a favor while I'm down here." She positions the knife over Clara's heart, looks straight into her eyes, and stabs it down slowly, twisting it in, never once breaking her gaze. "This is for Shava," she whispered. "And I'd tell you to rot in hell, but we're already here."

_Any amount of smugness her face once held melts away as you twist the blade. The dagger cut through ribs with surprisingly little effort, and as you withdraw the blade from the wound, blood begins to pour from the hole._ 
_But do you stop there?_

I mean that depends is she definitely dead?

_She's still bleeding, there's still light in her eyes at the moment_ 
_By all accounts, that wound is lethal, but she hasn't bled out yet_

I eldritch blast her in the chest
bitch gotta die

 _You jam your fingers into the stab wound and mutter a word, and her chest bursts. She screams in agony, but the scream is cut short by the holes in the bottom of her lungs._ _She stares at you, all contempt replaced by pure, primal fear._
_But do you stop there?_

u keep asking that! uuuuuh lemme think
do the doors lock from the inside?
not that if would stop anyone from trying hard enough but like for dramatic effect reasons?

_there are interior locks_

Jenga gives her a distasteful look, as if she's looking at a stubborn roach. "You just won't die, will you?" She sits back on the bed, watching. "I fully intend to kill you. Or you could apologize, and maybe the cleric will come in time to save you." Jenga paces to the door and clicks the lock closed. "Or maybe not." She watches Clara intently, every piece of her focused in like a cat ready to pounce.
Then Jenga kind of laughs. "Can you even talk now? I guess I may have screwed you over on that front, huh?"
"I'm sure you could convey that you're sorry one way or another, perhaps, if you desire to."

_Her mouth moves as if to say something, but there is no air in her lungs._ 
_A few more seconds pass, before she falls forward, her horns hittng the floor first. One of them cracks off._

She's dead, then?

_You kick her to check. she twitches the first time. not the second._

"Too late, it seems." Jenga walks to the door and unlocks it. "Lorcan, I may have made a bit of a mess. Well, she did, bleeding out everywhere, I just stabbed her. And blasted her in the chest. She did deserve it though."

_"If anyone asks, she never arrived here."_

"Never met her in my life, no. Or my death, I guess."

---------------------

This entire time, Lorcan has been doing his taxes and giving her... sex advice, basically, in her head. It's probably not good advice.
