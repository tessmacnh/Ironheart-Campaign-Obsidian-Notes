The party continues into the desert.
On the morning of the 64th, Larry's compass wavers. The sun is still in the sky, however, so they go west accordingly. 
The next day, they are about to do the same, when Larry points to some tools he had set out. He arranged them the previous night to point west, but now they are pointing north-east, and for some reason, that's where the sun is rising. The party decides to keep following the sun.
 Lunima names her camel Bartholomew Jenkins. Jenga starts teaching Spit Turret to spit on command. Ruey, travelling as a camel, spits on Jenga and Lunima.
 
 Jenga gets Lunima to do drugs with her out of boredom. Lunima asks "what takes pain away the fastest?"
 Jenga says, "well, I have one that just kills you."
 Lunima takes a dose of [[Magic Drugs|Psychopomp]]. She comes back crying, and wipes away a tear. She says that they are closer to Menagerie, as she learned during the Commune spell. She also says the 'black ships' know that she exists but are not yet hunting her. She reveals to the party that she is a Kalashtar, meaning that there is a light spirit inside of her, and her parents warned her of black ships that may hunt her down.
 
 Jenga and Sarya do Quickling, and Lunima just says "surprise me" so Jenga gives her Vapours. She gives it to Ruey who is in the form of a camel, and the camel dissolves in mist. She later collapses as Ruey and turns back into a camel.
 
 At the end of the day, the party meets a goblin on camel-back.
 "Hello! Where you be going?"
 Party: "Menagerie."
 Goblin: "Oh, Menageria, you're going to Menagerie, yeah? I know the way."
 An insight check shows they are fucking with us.
 Finnwell: "He's messing with us."
 Goblin: "I'm a lady! My friends call me Aremi. I can take you to Menagerie!"
 The party doesn't believe the goblin, and they set up camp without it. Animals approach the set up tools, and Ruey discovers that they talk in Draconic. She wakes Haz to translate.
 Haz speaks to them a bit.
 Ha: "They live here. What you want me asking?"
 Ruey: "Why are they messing with the tools?"
 Haz: "They just looking."
 Ruey: "Why do they speak Draconic and not animal?"
 Haz: "Copper big dragon bless them. Apparently very nice. She big and nice, she very smart."
 Ruey: "They are actual animals?"
 Haz: "Yes, they not here before dragon,have mums and dads, not people that are animals."
 Ruey: "They seem to be animals, none of them seem smarter than animal-smart. Ask if they know the way to Menagerie."
 Haz: "They know big copper dragon is nice, but not where."
 Ruey: "Ask them to not move our tools. They can only look."
 The animal scatter.
 Haz: "Okay animals, go away, me is go sleep now." He goes back near Jenga.
 
 The next morning, the tools were not messed with but the sun still rises in a different place. The goblin from before approaches.
 "Greetings, I see you're still lost."
 Jenga: "No, we're just seeing all of the cactus, duh."
 Sarya: "What would it take to see Menagerie?"
 The goblin strokes her chin with a shit-eating grin, and Jenga denies that the party needs her help.
 
 The next day, the silhouette of a dragon is still being seen ocassionally. The party sees a plume of smoke and heads for it, but it's a camp belonging to the same goblin. The party finally offers gold to be taken to Menagerie, and Jenga offers drugs. Ruey offers a flower from the Feywild. Larry offers a bush that grows jumping beans, which finally seals the deal.
 The party follows the goblin and they finally see shimmering sandstone walls, many meters tall.
 
 After a very long time, they have made it to [[Menagerie (City)|Menagerie]].
 
 "Welcome to Menagerie," the goblin says, then vanishes.
 It is a noisy place with merchants, tarps and tents and booths galore, a market stretching to the edge of sight, mosaics on the walls and colorful tiles before their feet. Buildings are 2-3 stories with domed roofs, and everywhere around there are spices, devices, and various wares.
 
 The party heads for the [[Silver Key Stronghold (Menagerie)|Silver Key Stronghold]]. Thiala leads them through a labrynth of streets, and they come to a building with the crest of [[Eilistraee]] on the doorframe. 
 Thiala: "I believe this concludes our contract. Let me get your payment."
 She is inside for a while and returns with a large pouch and a case.
 "As payment for your assistance to us, we have not only the original 10,000 gold promise-" she hands the money to Jenga, who hands it off to Larry- "I've received permission to grant you this blade." She reveals a well made silver rapier. "This is the [[Song of Liberation]]. A blade handed down among the Silver Key for a long time, but it's not used much, to our discredit. I believe it is well founded in your hands." She gives it to Sarya, and it hums in her hands. "The blade will speak to you. I recommend heeding it, it knows what it speaks of."
 
 The party finds [[The Thousand Sands Hotel]], and pay for 7 rooms. Lunima finds a scroll vendor, and Jenga goes to a brothel. Ruey buys a pretty copper necklace set with an opal, and Sarya buys a Cloak of Protection.
 
 They go to the palace to find the Copper Dragonlord. It's to the north of the town. The guards outside it say they don't monitor the coming and going of the dragonlord and don't know if she is inside, but they will pass word of us on to the dragonlord, Aeramen,who is described as being very old and strange.
 
 Jenga finds booze called sake (aka Cactus Juice) and buys an entire barrel.
 
 Lunima finds the manuscript for the book she's been working on missing from her room. Tracking the item, it seems to be moving in a different part of town. The party gives chase. There is a figure on a rooftop running. They pop out of a Forcecage cast on them and drop into an alleyway. They seem to then disappear around a corner, and are now a different figure, but the Locate Object is still pinging on them.
 "Catch me if you can!" They yell, and creates a cloud of gas. Lunima and Ruey Dimension Door on top of the thief and Ruey, as a wolf, tries to grapple them, but it doesn't work. The thief rounds a corner and the party keeps chase, only to find themselves in a dead end, and the manuscript now warded against detection.
 They ask a guard why nothing was done, and the guard answers, "if the theft is unwarranted, the Dragonlord herself prosecutes it. She has a deep understanding of the underbelly of the city, and only allows to exist what does no harm."
 Lunima: "She didn't do anything about my book cause it was warranted?"
 Guard: "I don't question her, she's been around much longer than you or I have."
 
 The party returns to the hotel dejected, Lunima is upset, but she lays on her bed only to feel something under her chest: It's the manuscript. Tucked between the pages is a Scroll of Non-Detection, and the first few chapters now have every spelling error marked. Lunima had promised Ruey a kiss if they got it back, and a promise is a promise, so she kisses Ruey on the cheek.
 
 The party sells some of the scrolls they got in the cult base to a man named [[Arkan]], and arrange with him to find buyers for their 9th level spell scrolls. Jenga buys drugs for her and Ruey. She also gets quality lockpicks as a gift for Haz. Haz gives her a black pearl earring, and as a woman passes buy shouting about a thief, Jenga pretends to examine some melons.
 
 That night, Lunima finished her manuscript, and Larry does some tinkering and learns how to make flashlights.
 
 Sarya wakes the next morning and goes to Lunima's room. She requests to be warded, particularly from blades and possibly magic. Lunima gathers the party.
 Sarya explains that an informant of hers told her that someone was coming after her. Someone went to her old house in the Feywild, and showed interest in her dead wife. Whoever it is, they will be in Menagerie within a day or a week. Lunima gets permission from the clerk to ward the hotel room.
 
 Jenga buys sending stones and on the way back to the party, runs past a merchant who accused her of stealing from his shop. He had her mistaken for someone else, and claims all elves look the same. Jenga alerts Sarya that there may be a wood elf in the area, as Sarya suspects her persuer to be a wood elf like her wife was.
 
 Sarya does Commune via a spirit session. Her persuer is hostile, but possible not wanting to come to blows. They don't like Sarya, but could come to stab her.
 
 The party makes arrangements to stay at the hotel for two weeks. They offer a companion service. Lunima hires one to edit her book. Jenga hires one to "edit" her "book."
 
 Jenga's companion is an older human woman named [[Kiki]]. Lunima gets a woman her age named [[Alasha]]. Alasha flirts with Lunima.
 Sarya gets assigned a wood elf named [[Katya]], which makes her nervous. Katya stands guard in the lobby.
 
 Lunima thinks her editor is acting weird. She knocks on Jenga's door, but Jenga is *occupied* at the moment. She goes to Yri next, but he isn't helpful either, and the dictionary defintion of 'companion' doesn't explain the strange behaviour.
 Eventually, Alasha succeeds in seducing Lunima.
