Going into a room past the ritual room, a gun is pressed to Lunima's forehead, but it's only Larry, who locked himself in by accident and has been stuck in this room for over a day.
The room is full of webs, which Lunima burns away. Unfortunately, the party is attacked (notes unclear as to by what, implies that things come to life, I think they were like statues or something?)

Next is a room of intense wind, which the party also passes, and then a room with a throne of stone and precious metal, on which is an unresponsive skeletal figure. It holds a wand the party cannot identify. Jenga loots a set of [[Statue Set|statues]] made of precious metal that corrospond to the schools of magic.

Moving on, the party finds a bedroom, from which they loot heated bedsheets, unforunately triggering a fear spell that affects Jenga, Larry, and possible others unmentioned in notes. Jenga dispels the fear on Larry once she breaks out of her own.
They loot a dozen decorative statues, and 5 dozen old books.

The party fights a boneclaw in what is a very difficult fight, after which they decide to take a long rest in the lich's bedroom.
This was a mistake.

The long rest is disrupted by the demilich himself. After a long fight against him, the party goes to destroy the phylactery with what holy water they have left. Jenga makes the mistake of touching it accidentally, and when she does, her soul is torn from the body. Thankfully, because Jenga sold her soul, there's a split-second custody battle for it and it ends up back in her body.

With the destroying of the phylactery, the storm over the island clears. Sarya hands over to Jenga the [[Tome of Leadership and Influence]]. The party loots scrolls, and a spellbook of necromancer spells with a guide to flesh golems.
They also get
- 8 gemstones, each worth 5000 gold
- art pieces each worth 7500
- ceremonial bone armor with defensive enchantments
- an [[Iron Flask]] containing a succubus
- a bronze warhorn
- a rapier with plate armor from sharpened bone
- 7989gp and 1700pp

Jenga also finds, on the skeletal form, [[Robes of the Archmagi]]. Lunima determines that due to their black color, they can only be worn by those who are evil-aligned. Jenga tries them on for fashion purposes but ends up attuning to them, prompting the party and honestly herself as well to question her morality.
