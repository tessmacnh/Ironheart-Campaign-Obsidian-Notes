The party takes a long rest outside of the base. They grab supplies from the ship and Clarity argues that if they find Jenga and Haz, they can revive them. 

They find a second enterance, a larger stone door with engravings on it. Guards out from of it keep watch. They kill the guards easily. From the pocket of one is a stone that speaks.
"Fellow servant of the true eternal, what notice have thy of thine watchpost? Intruders? ahead?"
Yri replies to it. "No, a movement in the woods startled us."
Stone: "Good to hear."

The party discusses using the robes to infiltrate the cult. They capture a cultist and interrogate him. He's related to a townsfolk named [[Zelly]]. 
The interrogation reveals that the cultists are ranked in roughly:
Those who don't know magic < believers (like him and other guards) < warlocks blessed by the [[Limos|True Eternal]] < those known as Courtasians of the True Eternal, then the head of the cult and the True Eternal.
The cultist refers to the nagas as the 'Humbled Ones' and has been part of the cult for a year or two. He also reveals that there are holding cells near the arena.

Gymmy says he will pose as a cleric wanting to join the cult. They figure out how to walk to bypass the wards, and that speaking the name of the 'Eternal Lord' will temporary shut off the ward symbols so one can pass.

The sending stone says through it, "I know the entry ritual was tough on you, Ana, but I know you're cut out to be with us. Be careful, I don't want something bad happening to you. Stop by the kitchen, I have something I wanna say to you."
The robes are made of nice silk, and the captive has a tattoo in abyssal with the name of the True Eternal on it- [[Limos]].

Inside the cult base in a dark hallway that is well warded. Saying the name 'Limos' out loud makes the symbols of warding glow. Due to a lack of robes to use as disguises, the party decides to disguise Lunima as a prisoner in the hopes that she can help Sarya and Finnwell escape, whereever they are. They fake-gag her.
Yri falls through a trapdoor into a flesh river in the crypts below but apparently this isn't uncommon and a true believer will be sent down to get him. It's also implied Lunima will be used for a "show" later, and she is handed off to the deathlocks.
Yri sees around him a bunch of closed tombs. The believer who gets him mentions that there were intruders and they broke a bridge. They give Yri a medallion to get around with. 
The cultists remarks, "yeah, they captured a bunch. Two live captives and two new experiments." They remark that some experiment involves making powerful undead from spellcasters, and then adds, "not sure what they're doing with the lizard thing." (referencing Haz)
The live captives may be used in a prisoner exchange with the nagas, or in a pitfight. 

Finnwell, meanwhile, after surrender had been led off and knocked out by something. He and Sarya are in a chamber with six other prisoners. Finnwell breaks his binds and unties Sarya. Lunima comes in, escorted by deathlocks. Once all free of minds, they communicate with Lunima's telepathy. 
The cell is warded against teleportation and the guards notice the attempt. Sarya dispels the magic, and the prison bust turns into a fight. It's going poorly, and Lunima falls after killing some cultists with a fireball, but thankfully, Clarity arrives as backup and revives Sarya when she ends up dead in the fight.
On the bodies, the cultists had holy symbols, and the warlocks in particular have a sigil of the lich.
