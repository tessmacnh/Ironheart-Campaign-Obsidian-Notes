Jenga hired people to cross the desert back to [[Azurport]]. Before leaving she buys some drugs and her and Haz then depart. After five days of travel, they reach Azurport and unite again with [[Heian]], explaining why they are alone and what happened. Jenga sells all the camels except for her own, [[Spit Turret]], and the "winter camel" that was Gymmy's.

Jenga prepares to depart and has a dream from Lorcan.
L: "We have two tasks ahead of us. The first of those tasks is to bring Shava to an associate of mine who knows how to break the curses set upon her. Now, they're an associate of mine and a *cunning* associate of mine, they know better than to make deals with devils, no offense, and I have no agreement with them to the rendering of services, only for you to have an audience. You will have to negotiate by yourself with what you're offering in exchange for their cursebreaking expertise. The Upside is that they are specifically associated with unweaving the curses laid by the spider queen and her ilk. The other tasks which take place before and after involve the locations of several hopeful mutual friends of ours. First thing's first, you're going to head up the Iron Coast towards Brazenfell and stop in the Bernato Alliance and... Pick up the fruits of our labor, so to speak."
Jenga recognizes that he is talking about the owner of the stall she left the rock from the demon mines at.
L: "The first stop of the journey is to cross the sea from there and end up in Elefesen. I will note you cannot take the route you came from the entire way back, you're going to need to make a wide berth around Prospero. The reason should be clear with due time. But in any case, you can rely on your existing charts to get through to Fortuna at a minimum. The fact that you made a point to draw said maps should mean that even lacking a navigator, you should have no problem."
J: "Nice, I did a smart thing."
L: "You should have the rest of the time to yourself. Try not to kill yourself."
J: "I don't plan on it. Unless I do that funky drug."
L: "I don't object to you using it in case of emergencies, but don't make it a habit."
J: "I'll use the other ones."
L: "I'll leave this to you, then."

Jenga departs on the 76th, and has 14 days to go until reaching Fortuna. She examines Shava and can tell that she has not been fed well. There are miscellaneous marks and scars on her body, though none are cursed like her eye, ear, and tongue. Nothing is infected and there doesn't seem to be a risk of her dying. There is a single rune carved into the small of her back, seemingly drawn in ink, done by a second author unlike the other runes.
Jenga determines that there is nothing being registered by Shava, and she is effectively a prisoner in her own mind, possibly for the best.

Haz reveals to Jenga that he gets most of his shinies from the sailors, who come back fromport with shiny things, likely tokens from women, and they don't want to be scolded if the captain or first mate find out, so they give them to Haz.
Jenga and Haz do drugs, specifically [[Magic Drugs|Salamander]], making them warm/fuzzy feeling and fireproof. Jenga asks Haz about his childhood.
Haz: "Me had den. Den was family. Not much other... Every kobold in den was family until they not. Dragon speaker met red dragon, came back with gift of blood, and Many-Scales as well."
J: "Huh?"
Haz: "Remember dragon speaker redder? Gift of blood from dragon. Many-Scales also had gift of blood. So did Clanks-When-Steps but from long ago."
J: "How long to kobolds live?"
Haz: "Long as living."
They then both drink cactus juice and pass out.

On the 80th, Jenga decides to take the drug Sea Nectar, which makes immersion in water feel immensely pleasurable. She goes invisible entirely naked, takes a dose, and jumps in the ocean, tied to the ship by a rope. After enjoying herself, she teleports into her room, gets dressed again, and scares [[Buddy]] from behind, who is looking over the railing and nervously checking his wrist watch. Jenga is practically falling over and gets helped to her room.

On the 81st, Clarity teleports to the ship with Jenga's [[Rod of the Pact-Keeper]], finally upgraded to +3 status. The handle is repolished and nice looking, the red gemstone seems to have grown and deepened in color, and the hilt was replaced with the one from the Isle Boros cult.

The next day, Jenga chats with the crew from Boros and learns some of their stories, ranging from being born there, to commiting crimes that ought not to be crimes, to fleeing persecution.

The 85th, Jenga gets high with some of the crew and tells some of her life story and time she spent in Hell to them. Oni teases her about not being with an orange tiefling, since Jenga specifically left Clara out of the story. Since [[Nowhere]], an orange tiefling, is on the boat, this gets a bit awkward.

On the 87th, Jenga does Sea Nectar but it doesn't hit like it usually does, so she tries Vapours. Her body disintegrates into fog, and doing this on a moving ship was a bad idea. She starts to slip away in portions and is vaguely aware of knocking, then slamming, on her door. Some people enter and just pass through her. She drifts out onto the deck and over the hull. Suddenly, there is a jolt of antimagic, and she is in her own body again, falling 30 meters (notes say meters, thinking it may have been feet instead?) and hitting the deck. Heian looks down at her.
"What in god's name are you doing?"
Jenga learns that Buddy had been knocking and got worried when there was no response. Haz hugs Jenga, who feels bad for making him worry.
Heian: "You know what, I hold no authority over you, but I politely suggest that you avoid that drug, at least when on a moving vehicle."

The boat arrives in Fortuna on the 89th. Jenga and Haz hang out with the crew in a taver and look for magic items. Jenga buys an elixir of health, thinking if anything is wrong with Shava when she is free of the curses, this could aid that.

She then has another dream, that night.
Lorcan: "So, the necessity to take a berth around Prospero will add a week to your travel time. If you feel brave and capable you could take a closer perimeter."
J: "What's going on in Prospero?"
L: "I'm going to make a bet you'll be safe close enough to look with your familiar. The next port confirmed to be safe is most likely Lustreo. That's another two week journey. I recommend stocking up on entertainment. I would say books but... You're you."
J: "Ah, but porn books."
L: "Well, even backwater places like Fortuna have entertainers with little connection to a home."
J: "Oh, I could see if any one of them wants to travel on a ship?"
L: "Indeed."
J: "Not a bad idea."
L: "Once in Lustreo, after that it's only another week's voyage, at which point you'll each the last port in Aesager that you're stopping at. Remember to try not to kill yourself with boredom. Get something for the weeks ahead or use what you have more efficiently."

Jenga buys some books at the library. [[The Amber Letters]], [[Tusk Love]], and [[Sins of a Silver Prince]]. She finds a book titled "Heresy Among Heretics, an Account of Fragmentation in a Fantastic Cult to an Elder God" but it doesn't catch her interest much.

Jenga starts reading The Amber Letters as her journey goes into Autumn, then starts on Tusk Love. On the dawn of the 7th, she goes to the wheel and sees a billowing plume of smoke in the distance. Where the skyline of Prospero should be, there is nothing. On the horizon is instead a smoking black pile, and at the apex is a crimson shape that shifts, raising a head and letting out a spine-chilling roar. Jenga immediately begins navigating around it.
