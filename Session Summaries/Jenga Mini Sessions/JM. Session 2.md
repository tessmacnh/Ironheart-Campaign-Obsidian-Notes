Clouds form as Jenga takes a wide berth around Prospero, but a storm of fire quickly forms. She braces herself at the wheel, reminded of the storm around Isle Boros, but this time there is no healer, and she is the only one above deck. She uses Armor of Agathys again to help survive, and when the ship sails through at last, sails on fire and Jenga collapsed on the ground, covered in burns, she is at 4 hit points.
The crew puts out the fires, and Jenga takes a rest to recover, as she has no means of magical healing, meaning the scars she got will not go away.

She has 3 weeks until she arrives in [[Grandeport]]. She gets halfway through Sins of a Silver Prince before arriving in Lustreo. After spending time there, they continue on, passing by Isle Boros where they see ships anchored. Clearly the people there are rebuilding.

Finally in Grandeport, Jenga meets a young man in a trenchcoat with a large backpack and suitcase.
Man: "Would you be Squallsong?"
Jenga: "My name's Jenga, it's good to meet you."
Man: "You're taking me to Soldaten?"
J: "Yup."
Man: "I am [[Tristan La Citta]]. Artificer." He has dark hair and dark eyes. 
Jenga shows him to the guest cabin where he pulls a stone from the suitcase, puts it on the ceiling, and it lights up when he taps it.

Jenga goes to the bookstore. She buys three books, [[Of Silk and String]], [[Truer Faith]], and [[The Cat of the Southern Scar]]

Jenga has another dream, but it's short, and Lorcan just informs her to stop in Elefesen.

She speaks to Tristan, who says he was glad to get away from Grandeport. He pulls out a cylindrical device with a button on it.
Tristan: "You want to do the honors, or shall I?"
J: "What is this?"
T: "A parting gift to the people who raised me."
Jenga, very excitedly, slams the button. As they depart from the port, two buildings on land explode, and there is distant screaming.
Jenga: "Did they suck?"
T: "They sucked." He explains that they ran the town orphanage. He keeps the name 'La Citta' in spite of them. The buildings that just exploded weren't the orphanage, just the houses of those who ran it, and no one was in them at this hour.
T: "I'm heading where my talents for the destructive can be appreciated. Proficiency in gunpowder is only one of my talents." He takes from his case what seems to be a crossbow mixed with a rod foci and points it over the ocean. Pulling a level, a bolt of eldritch energy flies out.
T: "The power bestowed upon me by Lorcan, put into a device that can be used by any."
Jenga tries it out, and it thrilled to cast Eldritch Blast without the pain from her bracers.
