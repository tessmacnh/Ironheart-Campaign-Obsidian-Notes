Jenga introduces Tristan to Haz. Haz thinks he is like Larry but less ice, and more burning. Buddy informs Jenga that they are short a week of food. Jenga instructs some of the crew to fish and finds out that thankfully, Tristan knows the spell Create Food and Water.

Jenga reads through more of her books. The ship heads through a storm easy enough. By the final week of travel the weather has gotten warmer. Jenga lets Tristan know what they'll be there soon, though she was actually incorrect as she didn't realize that the storm set them back a week. She apologizes for the misinformation, saying that she's still 'in another world' from the books she's been reading. Tristan asks what books and she tries to deflect the question before admitting she's been reading porn books. Tristan questions why she was so secretive about it, saying they both sold their souls to a devil, and Jenga conceeds to that point.

Jenga does some drugs, and later plays poker with Haz and Tristan. Haz doesn't have a poker face. Tristan puts up a fight but Jenga ultimately wins.
T: "You have a sharper mind than you let on."
J: "I really don't."
T: "I didn't say you use it to good ends. But you have a spark in you."
J: "I'll leave the smart mindiness to you."

Jenga and Haz fish. Haz is surprisingly good at fishing.
"Congratulations on your catches" Heian approaches them.
J: "Hey Heian! We got fish! Haz got five."
H: "I'm not one for fishing. I thought I'd let you know, last night I did some magical scouting. We're coming up on land. By tomorrow evening we should be there, which is good cause we're down to scraps as far as food supplies goes. That boy is a lifesend with the food and water. It's flavorless but better than nothing."
J: "Conjured food is gross, yeah."
H: "Nonetheless... I know I am speaking to the kettle and pot, but, that child has darkness in him."
J: "Tristan?"
H: "Yes."
J: "He's... Not a child?" She knows he seems to be around 20.
H: "My bad, I forget... It takes longer for elves to be considered mature. Forgive a five or so year difference in number. The more important thing is: What were the first things you did with the power from your patron?"
J: "Uh, I exploded some trees, then I just kept being a bandit until I started adventuring."
H: "The first thing this child did is make a weapon of war."
J: "It's a cool weapon."
H: "It's impressive artifice but I don't think he knows what it can be used for. I worry someday he'll have a conscious and have it strained by recognition of what he's done."
J: "Huh?"
H: "The work of his own hands, used to wage war en mass to kill many people. War is inescapable and the means to fight efficiently are good, but... I'm worried he'll wake up and think himself a murderer. Of course, I realize who I'm speaking to."
J: "People make weapons of war all the time. Like swords. Or bows. or cannons. If Tristan has a crisis over it, that's his problem, frankly."
Heian's attitude grows a bit more formal, and he excuses himself and leaves. Jenga is left confused. She thinks that people die in war all the time. If someone kills a person with one of Tristan's devices, they chose to do that, not Tristan. 

One the 81st, the ship arrives in the town of [[Eisenhafen]]. The crew feasts on the remaining food. Jenga pays a fee to dock and is recommended to pick up a charter in the capital [[Elfenbein]]. Jenga pays the crew and waits for morning.
Predictably, she has a dream that night.

Lorcan: "How was your crossing of the Iron Sea?"
Jenga: "Not bad."
L: "A week's delay is a week's delay, I suppose. You are to ring the tip of the continent, and will find yourself at the furthest port upshore, in hobgoblin territory. There is the closest port to your destination in Elefesen, and where you will meet our next mutual acquaintance. I would recommend you find a way to get fast coin. I'd recommend you disregard the law to get it down faster, but you've seen how they're prepared to deal with such things. These are strict folk. By the way, my acquaintance of yours who will be helping you, they are not a warlock but a former business associate."
J: "They're at the next place I'm going?"
L: "In Elfenbein. And in case the terminology confuses you, the locals call the Iron Sea with Eisensee."
Lorcan advices she get more money by selling things she doesn't need. Jenga explains she still has plenty of platinum, she just dislikes spending it cause it always feels like she is spending a lot.
L: "The port you'll be stopping at for the second task on this journey is [[Startpunkt]]." This is a point past Elfenbein. "By the way, I'll reiterate, if you ever are considering something unlawful that you have even the slightest lack of confidence in your ability to pull off, I'd suggest *not*. They're quite millitant around here."

Having gotten the warning to not do crime, Jenga immediately goes to do crime. In order for a better bank rate exchanging platinum to gold, she magically disguises herself as a hobgoblin and casts 'Tongues' so she can speak goblin. She goes to the bank, acting perfectly as if she belongs there, and gives the fake name 'Jennlein Sturmgesang.' She then buys rations for the ship and some potions.

Jenga learns that Soldaten has two elected rulers. The Kriegsherr handles external affairs, and the Heimatherr handles internal affairs.

Jenga buys another book, [[A Record of the Iron Wars]], and decides to wait until she can pick up a shipment before leaving, so she can make money by travelling. 
During the days she is waiting, she finds a small magic item shop and it interested in a bag of magic beans. It's priced at 6000 gold and even negotiating it to 2500, Jenga doesn't want to spend that much, so she leaves, offending the goblin shopkeep. Jenga then realizes that this shop is in the middle of nowhere with one employee and is a great target to rob, so she disguises herself as a hobgoblin woman and returns. She browses the store, giving the goblin woman continuous fleeting glances, and flirts a bit with her until finally asking, "I don't suppose you have any more goods in the back?" Suggestively.
The goblin says, "I do if you carry me," and Jenga picks her up. She tells her to make herself comfy, then barricades the goblin in the back room and cleans out the register, as well as stuffing a Bag of Holding with a potion of etherealness, 30 enchanted wands, and the bag of beans. She then goes back to the back room and tries to knock out the goblin, but misses. She manages to play it off and instead continues the suggestive approach, to the point where the goblin lets Jenga tie her up. Jenga hog-ties the woman, blindfolds and gags her, and leaves. 
She proceeds to get drunk at a tavern and the next morning can only vaguely remember commiting theft of some sort.
She finally gets a shipment of fabric and rugs to transport on the ship, getting 1500 gold up front and the same on delivery, and loads it up. The ship departs.
It will be three weeks to get to the capital Elfenbein, then another three to get to Startpunkt.
