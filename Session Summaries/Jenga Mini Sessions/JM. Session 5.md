Jenga explores the town as she waits for a shipment contract to be available. She buys some spice for Haz, and the next morning gets a shipment of ginger loaded onto the ship. They set sail.
As usual, she keeps reading through her books. On the 41st, she comes to Startpunkt. Whereas Eisenhafer and Elfenbein were more like cliffside fortresses, this city rises from the middle of a large flatland, on the border of what seems to be a stretch of wilted ground, [[The Southern Scar]]. She pulls into port and shows her documents.

She receives instruction in a dream that night.
Lorcan: "So, Jenga, your task is to head north not into the Scar itself but further inland. You are to find an isolated hut and meet its resident. There is dissident against the hobgoblin's rulership of this land. Give them the means to defend themselves. Prove to them I can provide those means, and we'll find ourselves with another mutual acquaintance."

Jenga pays the crew and gets Haz and [[Arn]] to accompany her inland. They head out the west gate and start walking through the wastes. They are quickly exhausted while walking through the Scar but make it out by nightfall. They don't have wood for a fire but make camp regardless.

They are interrupted the next morning by a loxodon armed with a staff.
Loxodon: "State your business."
Jenga throws up her hands. "We're travelling please don't fight me."
L: "Travelling or poaching?"
J: "I have rations, we have no need to poach, you can see."
The loxodon looks them over. "I've been too hasty. I am [[Lumusi]]. I've had enough conflict with poachers in recent times to justify regular wariness. They take the tusks of sacred beasts, or me and my kin. And they can all but get away with it for the fact that we live outside of the hobgoblin's walls. For all their claims of protection, they've only worsened things for us. Pardon me for the lack of hospitality. Let me show you to my lodging."
Lumusi leads the trio to a simple lodge.
L: "I normally travel with the herd I protect but I requested them to stay away while I investigated you and your lot." She starts cooking porridge with native grains and fruits. "Eat. It is clear to my eyes you have been traversing the deadland."
J: "Yeah, we were for a day or so."
L: "A day too long to be in there."
Jenga asks what she meant by poachers.
L: "Foreigners leave the Soldaten walls. Soon as they're out of sight of the guards, they hunt the sacred beasts. Should me or my people try to intercept them, we are hunted as well. They cut off our tusks, bring them back, and claim they purchased them from locals or otherwise sourced them legally. I'm adept at the ways of the wild, but I cannot fight them off myself and I've had the terrible decision to make... leading the herd away while we are weak means the sick are caught in the back."
J: "What if you had a better way to defend them?"
L: "Do you suggest I hire guards?"
J: "I mean if you took on a new skillset." She casts Armor of Agathys and the icy protection covers her skin.
L: "Armor of ice... I've never seen such a thing before."
J: "I can show you other talents you've never seen before."
Lumusi requests a further demonstration. She says poachers will come from the north, and wants Jenga's help dealing with them. Jenga follows Lumusi to a herd of elephants and other loxodon. 
Lumusi talks to them, then says, "the others have agreed to accept your assistance. Night will fall. When it does, you ought to be ready."
Jenga travels with the herd until the sun grows red and low. The herd prepares. There are six (maybe 7??) people approaching with crossbows. Another person with them seems to be a mage, wearing a lighter robe and no armor. Lumusi readies her tusks.
L: "Show your skills. They deserve little mercy."
Jenga uses Eldritch Blast to down the mage and a poacher. The remaining five turn to flee. Lumusi gores another one on her tusks, and Jenga Fireball's the last four, rendering them to ash.
Lumusi hoists up the tiefling mage, who isn't entirely dead yet. She binds her with a strip of leather.
L: "If you're willing to do this, I'd appreciate- should you return to the walls- if you hand this one over for poaching. You were efficient about slaying the rest. I'll admit, it's quite the skill set, young one."
J: "It is one you can have, should you wish."
L: "My mother before me and my father died protecting these lands and this herd. I intend to follow in their life path, if not their specific footsteps. In pursuit of doing so, this power would aid me greatly. How would I go about taking it?"
Jenga opens her Book of Shadows and draws from it a form, already with a single signature upon it. She hands it to Lumusi. Lumusi reads it, and her expression narrows.
L: "Do you know what you peddle, traveller?"
J: "Yes."
L: "A creature more foolish would sign gladly. One less desperate wouldn't sign at all." She pulls a quill and pricks her tongue before signing in her native script. The top layer of the contract incinerates, leaving only a carbon copy below.
L: "So I sign away my essence. A sacrifice for the protection of that which I care for. I can't shake the feeling that I'll regret it one day, but thank you, for bringing this offer to me."
Lumusi escorts Jenga and the tied up tiefling to Soldaten walls. Before departing, Lumusi says: "Before you go... We've known each other only for a short time, so in the eyes of some this may seem hasty, but I'd like for you to have this." She gives Jenga a dagger carved from ivory. Jenga asks what it is.
L: "A funeral dagger. Carved from the tusks of my father. I have the other of the set and shall keep it, but I have no use for them both and have this one to remember him by. I ask you to keep the other as thanks for the aid you've provided me with and the aid I will have forevermore."
J: "I'll carry it with me."

As Jenga takes the tiefling to the wall, the tiefling starts mumbling, "no, no, don't, anything but back there..."
Jenga sets down the tiefling and asks what she wants. She says the poachers kept everything not sold yet and she can show Jenga wear it is. They both head west to a cave, within which are a large amount of tusks and chests. Jenga loads most of it into a demiplane, then shoves the tiefling into the demiplane and contains her within the [[Iron Flask]].

After making camp for the night, Jenga turns in 100 pounds of ivory in exchange for 100 gold. She had considered selling it for more on a black market but couldn't be bothered with the hassle of it. She does not, however, turn in the tiefling. Jenga buys some food and returns to the ship, having a dream that night.

Lorcan: "Before you leave Startpunkt, there is one more individual here who will make a fellow acquaintance. I will make you know ahead of time, his appearance is fearsome, but not so mindless as other eyes would tell you they are. In the north-east quarter of the city, there's a bar that posits itself as the foremost location to purchase the service of mercenaries. Within there, quite ignored among peers in spite of sticking out, is our soon to be acquaintance."
J: "Anything in particular I'm offering?"
L: "A pact."
J: "Right, right." She had meant more like things to offer *via* the pact, such as giving Lumusi the ability to protect her people.
L: "At your discretion, I'd offer him a position among your crew. Belonging is what they stand to gain more than power."
After some other conversation, %%add here later tess%%the dream concludes.

Jenga finds a tavern called [[The Gilderblade]], translating to the 'gold blade' or more literally, 'sell sword'. It's a nice tavern in the middle of the slums, implying a source of 'dirty money'. 
Jenga enters and immediately sees, in a corner, a menacing looking figure. They have great curling goat horns, massive tusks and fangs, olive skin, and an upturned nose. Their eyes are like twin orbs of polished obsidian and their face is covered in scars. Fun fact, this is probably the most Sam has ever described an NPC ever.
