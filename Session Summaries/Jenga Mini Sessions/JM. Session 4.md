The waters are busy on the way to Elfenbein. Jenga keeps reading a lot, and travel goes smooth until Buddy informs her of a hole in the water. Jenga navigates around the whirlpool and asks Heian how they form. He says it could be a meeting of warm and cold currents, or a portal to an elemental plane, or perhaps the underdark or feywild. 
During one night of travel, Jenga sees distant flashes of fire and lightning: dragon breath. She sees hobgoblin warships below the exchange, and the sound of something massive splashing the water, and a grand roar from the sky.
The morning after that, she arrives in [[Elfenbein]]. It's as well defended as Brazenhold, and while it's not as tall a city, it's more intimidating. Jenga unloads the fabric from the ship and receives and 1500 remaining gold for the shipment.
Upon waking that morning, she had an address in her mind. She goes deep within the fortress to a shady part of the town. 
There's a shack between alleyways, and Jenga enters through a set of curtains. She's immediately surrounded by many knick-knacks, trinkets, and many books. There are silken curtains to sit on, and beyond that, in a black dress with a veil, sits a woman. She is very tall, even when seated. She has dark brown hair, a darker skin tone, and soft, almost motherly features. Most striking are her deep azure eyes.
"Hello, young one."
J: "Uh... Hi."
The woman relights some incense.
Woman: "If I did not know better, I'd offer you my services, but I'm under the belief that you are a friend of a friend of mine."
J: "That's correct."
Woman: "I suppose at least some of the formalities are unnecessary." She pulls an invisible string as she stands, and the curtains shut. With a snap, the flame on the incense vanishes, seemingly just an illusion.
Woman: "I am [[Ovirozu]]. A child of [[Archistus]]." She extends a hand. "Truly a pleasure."
Jenga shakes her hand.
O: "Do take a seat, it's rude of me to keep guests standing. If I'm to understand, you have bit of a curse problem not on yourself but on a companion of yours."
J: "Yeah."
O: "Have you brought them with you?"
Jenga takes out the box and opens it.
O: "Oh, child... Have you known them for some time?"
J: "Kind of. Not long enough."
O: "Considering what was removed from her, it seems she wronged someone higher in the chain, and was punished severely."
J: "I dunno, she was in the abyss for a long time."
Ovirozu twitches her fingers and Shava writhes a bit, moving thanks to spider silk attaching itself to her. Ovirozu circles her, tracing certain points of her body. She holds her hand to Shava's cheek and a pulse of arcane energy flashes.
O: "Well, isn't this something. You know, whoever did this to your friend is quite vindictive, even by drow standards. They didn't want anyone aiding her. From some of the runes though, it seems that's already occured. But, see, I don't do work without due compensation." The silk strands release, and Shava sinks back into the box.
J: "What do you want?"
O: "I am a child of Archistus, and that means by her divine mandate I am dedicated to collecting knowledge. Not just physical tomes but recollections of experiences, sights, sounds, smells. Feelings. Unfortunately for our mutual acquaintance, I've not much interest in the collection of souls or the sale of mine. So, I want to know if you can offer me something that would be a new and unique edition to my archives that I've spent many years building."
Jenga puts on the Headband of Intellect to brainstorm. In exchange for a summary of her journey here, Ovirozu will remove the secondary runes from Shava, so Jenga obliges. When she finished, Ovirozu says, "quite the tale. I believe that is more than due compensation to cover what we discussed. You can remain and watch or leave and do as you will."
J: "How long will this take?"
O: "No more than an hour."
J: "I'll stay here and watch."
When Ovirozu finishes, there is a flash of energy, and some runes glow and then vanish. Shava stirs, and then faces up again. Her head rests in Ovirozu's lap, who beckons over Jenga. Shava's one eye opens, and looks to Jenga, but she is silent.
J: "Can she hear us?"
O: "The connection between her nerves has been restored. She should be able to, although she's been Feebleminded. I'd describe it in more depth but I am fortunte and unfortunate in that my mind cannot be altered in such way. The important thing is, her intellect has been reduced drastically. She should still recognize you as someone she cares about, but not much beyond that."
J: "Is it reversible?"
O: "Certainly, I've dealt with many curses by the false spider queen over the years. But it takes time, and it's expensive."
Jenga talks to Shava, and reassures her that she will be fine, and Jenga will get her back no matter what it takes. She hugs Shava, who holds onto Jenga until Ovirozu taps her and she goes limp again.
O: "So, young Squallsong, what do you bring to the table?"
Jenga gives her some books from the Boros Cult. Ovirozu already has copies of some but takes about six of them.
O: "That is a beginning. Forbidden knowledge, forgotten knowledge... A beginning."
Jenga offers the [[Statue Set]] from the cult but it doesn't suit Ovirozu's interest. She describes her time in the [[Scholar Cult]]. Ovirozu confuses one of the people Jenga mentioned, [[Razia]], for an acquaintance of hers names Razarik.
They talk as Jenga brainstorms. Ovirozu says, regarding Lorcan, "the child has ambition. If you stop being useful to that ambition, you stop being useful to him."
Jenga tries to draw a portrait of Ovirozu but it's not very good.
Ovirozu proposes, "you don't seem to have much in the academic sense to relay, but you lead an interesting life. As an alternative, to study the runes on your friend here, I propose a complete sensory interface. It will take time to create but will allow me to see with your eyes, hear with your ears, taste with your tongue, feel with your skin, and smell with your nose. In your senses, I would experience the world as you do, I'd receive your living experience."
She explains that this would be permanent and require an invasive procedure. To connect the nervous system to a device it must be wholly stimulated, which means pain over the entire body running through everything you feel at once. She says it is done piecemeal, as even an arm at a time would kill you. It would be about a finger at once, and the procedure would take a day.
Not seeing any other option to help Shava, Jenga agrees. Ovirozu tells her to stop by the next day.

In her dreams that night, Lorcan advises against it.
L: "This is not going to work. The deal is not going to work."
J: "It's not?"
L: "Not that it won't function, but it would be compromising to my purposes."
J: "So I'll figure something else out? Kinda wouldn't mind, the procedure sounds horrible."
L: "You'd never have a private moment, she'd be privy to everything."
Jenga refrains from mentioning that she already doesn't have much privacy since Lorcan can see everything she does already.
J: "Ah. I don't tend to think long term."
L: "She'd be party to every embrace. I respect her a great deal but she desires knowledge as mortals desire gold. And so long as it isn't destructive, she cares little about the means she recieves it by."
J: "Do you have any ideas for anything else I can do?"
L: "The first time I made a deal with her, it was for ancient tomes I discovered. Last time, I had to resort to something more drastic. While the nerve connection is off the table, physical inspection is not."
J: "What do you mean?"
L: "She mentioned the possibility of a close observational period for Shava. (note: this wasn't mentioned in my notes and thus isn't in the recap but Ovirozu did bring up this option) I would suggest that first, but the second option is submitting yourself for the same period. There would still be a delay, which I wouldn't be fond of, but presumably with a conscious subject with their mind about them, it would be more swift. That is still undesirable however. Option three is a... Different kind of observation."
J: "Is that... An innuendo?"
L: "Yes. If you find that to be in poor taste, considering the goal of this deal, I may be able to muster some offerings. I'm sure she has little interest in the general economy of the hells, but I can locate from choice sources of knowledge she'd be willing to accept. But this would be preferable if I didn't have to send things to the material, it's a hassle to do that. And you would have to convince her that by accepting such a thing she isn't selling her soul. She tends to be skeptical of deals with my kind."
Jenga is very agreeable to the idea of an 'observational period' (wink wink nudge nudge).
L: "Do as you must, but do not prevent yourself from being able to leave in short order. I would like to remind you, it will take some time to remove the curses upon Shava. You'll be leaving the port and coming back later one way or another, don't get your hopes up."
J: "Why not leave her for observation then?"
L: "I have other things for you do to. An observation could take years. Go to her in the morning and explain yourself to her."
J: "I'll do that."
L: "Good luck."

Jenga returns to Ovirozu and turns down the sensory integration.
"What if I stay instead of Shava, it'll take less time."
Ovirozu steps next to Jenga and puts her chin on Jenga's shoulder.
O: "Are you suggesting a brief and thorough observation?"
J: "It was plan b but if you want to make it plan a then sure."
O: "Plan b? I assume Lorcan said no."
J: "He said 'not preferably.'"
O: "The boy's grown over the years. I thought he'd threaten you. I make a point to not owe Lorcan anything over the years, but you've not done the same, and yet... One of the things he promised me was he would never tell someone of me in exchange for anything. You being here means he did you a favor without an expectation of specific compensation. Maybe you ought to return the favor."
J: "To him?"
O: "In a roundabout sense." She wraps her hands around Jenga's chest.
J: "Is this a roundabout sense?"
O: "Perhaps."
J: "The logic is lost on me, but okay."
O: "One last time, this is what you are paying?"
J: "Yes."
O: "Very well, but I'll warn you, I do nothing simply."
Webbing surrounds Jenga and lifts her into the air. Ovirozu undoes her outfit. She tries to pry off the bracers but cannot remove them. She then puts a hand on Jenga's wrist. Jenga takes 63 psychic damage as the bracers fly off of her.
O: "The curse isn't gone, but I suppressed it enough to take them off. Liberating, isn't it?"
Jenga's hyped to have them off.
***Fade to black.***

Ovirozu lets Jenga down and Jenga gets dressed again.
O: "You've provided enough to seve as payment for my services. I will send word to you to return when the task is complete. For those purposes-" a small spider crawls into Jenga's hair.
J: "I'm not going to squish it, right?"
O: "It knows to avoid danger. Maybe don't go to a gnomish hairdresser." She explains that the spider will tell Jenga when it is time to return.
O: "By the way, while technically this is a lesser volume of knowledge than the full body sensory link, I still believe you're deserving of another favor should you need it. And if anyone asks, you came for a soothsaying."
Jenga looks at the box.
O: "Do you want to say goodbye?"
J: "Yes."
Jenga reassured Shava that everything is paid for, she's going to return, and everything will be already.She hugs Shava again and Ovirozu puts her back to sleep.
J: "Thank you again."
O: "I'm glad we reached an agreement." She then asks Jenga to not put the bracers back on until she has to fight. Jenga sees all the veins in her arm are visible, black under the skin.

Jenga buys a charter under the guise of a merchant, and returns to the ship.
